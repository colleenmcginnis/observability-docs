## Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of issues and share the details with colleagues.

1. Go to **Cases** -> **Create new case**.
1. Give the case a name, severity, and description.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    In the `Description` area, you can use
    [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) syntax to create formatted text.
    </DocCallOut>

1. Optionally, add a category, assignees, and tags.
    You can add users only if they meet the necessary <DocLink id="enObservabilityGrantCasesAccess">prerequisites</DocLink>.

1. Under External incident management system, select a <DocLink id="enObservabilityCasesExternalConnectors">connector</DocLink>. If
    you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the
    default setting is `No connector selected`.

1. After you've completed all of the required fields, click **Create case**.

## Add custom fields

<DocCallOut template="technical_preview" />
You can add optional and required fields for customized case collaboration.

1. Go to **Cases** -> **Settings**.

    ![View custom fields in case settings](images/cases-custom-field-settings.png)
    {/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    To view and change case settings, you must have the appropriate ((kib)) feature privileges. Refer to <DocLink id="enObservabilityGrantCasesAccess">Configure access to cases</DocLink>.
    </DocCallOut>

1. In the **Custom fields** section, click **Add field**.

    ![Add a custom field in case settings](images/cases-add-custom-field.png)
    {/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

1. Enter a field label.

1. Choose a field type: text or toggle.

1. If you want the text field to be mandatory in all cases, select **Make this field required**.

1. Optionally add a default value.

1. Click **Save field**.

You can subsequently remove or edit custom fields on the **Settings** page.

After you create custom fields, they're added to all new and existing cases.

Existing cases have null values for the new text fields until you set them in each case.

## Add email notifications

You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to
cases.

For hosted ((kib)) on ((ess)):

1. Add the email domains to the
    [notifications domain allowlist](((cloud))/ec-organizations-notifications-domain-allowlist.html).

    You do not need to take any more steps to configure an email connector or update
    ((kib)) user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
    used by default.

For self-managed ((kib)):

1. Create a preconfigured email connector.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    At this time, email notifications support only [preconfigured email connectors](((kibana-ref))/pre-configured-connectors.html),
    which are defined in the `kibana.yml` file.
    </DocCallOut>

1. Set the `notifications.connectors.default.email` ((kib)) setting to the name of
    your email connector.

1. If you want the email notifications to contain links back to the case, you
    must configure the [server.publicBaseUrl](((kibana-ref))/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl) setting.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.

<div id="add-observability-case-files"></div>

## Add files

After you create a case, you can upload and manage files on the **Files** tab:

![A list of files attached to a case](images/case-files.png)
{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

The acceptable file types and sizes are affected by your [((kib)) case settings](((kibana-ref))/cases-settings.html).

To download or delete the file or copy the file hash to your clipboard, open the action menu (â€¦).
The available hash functions are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

When you upload a file, a comment is added to the case activity log.
To view an image, click its name in the activity or file list.

<DocCallOut title="Note">

Uploaded files are also accessible in **((stack-manage-app)) > Files**.
When you export cases as [saved objects](((kibana-ref))/managing-saved-objects.html), the case files are not exported.

</DocCallOut>

## Manage existing cases

You can search existing cases and filter them by attributes such as assignees,
categories, severity, status, and tags. You can also select multiple cases and use bulk
actions to delete cases or change their attributes.

To view a case, click on its name. You can then:

* Add a new comment.
* Edit existing comments and the description.
* Add or remove assignees.
* Add a <DocLink id="enObservabilityCasesExternalConnectors">connector</DocLink> (if you did not select one while creating the case).
* Send updates to external systems (if external connections are configured).
* Edit the category and tags.
* Change the status.
* Change the severity.
* Remove an alert.
* Refresh the case to retrieve the latest updates.
* Close the case.
* Reopen a closed case.
