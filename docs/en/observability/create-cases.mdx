Collect and share information about observability issues by opening a case directly
in the Elastic ((observability)) app. Cases allow you to track key investigation details,
add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts,
comments, and visualizations. You can also send cases to third party systems by
<DocLink slug="/en/observability/cases-external-connectors">configuring external connectors</DocLink>.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
If you create cases in ((stack-manage-app)) or the ((security-app)), they are not
visible in ((observability)). Likewise, the cases you create in ((observability))
are not visible in ((stack-manage-app)) or the ((security-app)).
You also cannot attach alerts from ((stack-manage-app)) or the ((security-app)) to
cases in ((observability)).
