Applications running in a containerized environment like Kubernetes pose a
unique monitoring challenge: how do you diagnose and resolve issues with
hundreds of microservices on thousands (or millions) of containers, running
in ephemeral and disposable pods?

A successful Kubernetes monitoring solution has a few requirements:

* Monitors all layers of your technology stack, including:
    * The host systems where Kubernetes is running.
    * Kubernetes core components, nodes, pods, and containers running within
        the cluster.

    * All of the applications and services are running in Kubernetes containers.

* Automatically detects and monitors services as they appear dynamically.

* Provides a way to correlate related data so that you can group and explore
    related metrics, logs, and other observability data.

## What you’ll learn

This guide describes how to use Elastic ((observability)) to observe all layers of
your application, including the orchestration software itself:

* Collect logs and metrics from Kubernetes and your applications
* Collect trace data from applications deployed with Kubernetes
* Centralize the data in the ((stack))
* Explore the data in real-time using tailored dashboards and ((observability)) UIs

This guide describes how to deploy Elastic monitoring agents as DaemonSets using
the ((agent)) manifest files. For other
deployment options, see the Kubernetes operator and custom resource definitions
from [((ecloud)) on Kubernetes (ECK)](((eck-ref))/index.html).

## What’s next

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
    [((elastic-sec))](https://www.elastic.co/security). Adding endpoint protection is
    just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
    [Create alerts](((observability-guide))/create-alerts.html) and find out about
    problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use ((ml)) to
    [detect anomalies](((observability-guide))/inspect-log-anomalies.html).
