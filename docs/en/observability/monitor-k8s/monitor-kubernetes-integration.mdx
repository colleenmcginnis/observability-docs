## Part 1: Add and Configure the Kubernetes integration

To start collecting logs and metrics from your Kubernetes clusters, first add the [Kubernetes integration](((integrations-docs))/kubernetes) to your policy and configure the metrics and logs you want to collect.

<div id="monitor-k8s-add-integration"></div>

### Step 1: Add the Kubernetes integration to your deployment

Follow these steps to add the Kubernetes integration to your policy:
{/* add screenshots if necessary */}

1. Select **Add integrations** from your deployment's homepage.
1. Enter "Kubernetes" in the search bar, and select the **Kubernetes** integration.
1. Click **Add Kubernetes** at the top of the Kubernetes integration page.
1. Click **Add integration only (skip agent installation)** at the bottom of the Add integration page.

Continue to \<\<monitor-k8s-configure-integration>>.

<div id="monitor-k8s-configure-integration"></div>

### Step 2: Configure your Kubernetes integration

The Kubernetes integration can fetch metrics and logs from several components.
From the **Add Kubernetes integration** page, configure the options for the metrics and logs you want to collect.
The following sections outline the configuration options.

**Collect Metrics**

Collecting metrics about Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on top of them is a key aspect of Kubernetes observability.
You need to collect metrics about the resources running on the underlying infrastructure (for example, the machines of your Kubernetes cluster), metrics for the whole cluster, as well as individual metrics for the containers and pods.
Specifically, you need to monitor the health and performance of:

* The hosts where Kubernetes components are running. Each host produces metrics
    like CPU, memory, disk utilization, and disk and network I/O.
* Kubernetes containers, which produce their own set of metrics.
* The applications running as Kubernetes pods, such as application servers and
    databases, each producing its own set of metrics.
* Additional Kubernetes resources (like services, deployments, cronjobs) are valuable assets of the whole infrastructure
    and produce their own set of metrics that need monitoring.

((agent)) along with the Kubernetes integration provides a unified solution to monitor all layers of your Kubernetes technology stack, so you don't need multiple technologies to collect metrics.

You have the following options for collecting metrics about your Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on top of them:

* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-kubelet>>
* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-kube-state>>
* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-k8s-api-metrics>>
* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-k8s-proxy>>
* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-k8s-scheduler>>
* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-k8s-controller>>
* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-k8s-api-events>>

**Collect logs**

Collecting and analyzing logs of both Kubernetes core components and various applications running on top of Kubernetes is a powerful tool for Kubernetes observability.
Containers running within Kubernetes pods publish logs to stdout or stderr.

You have the following options for collecting Kubernetes logs:

* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-container-logs>>
* \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-audit-logs>>

<div id="monitor-kubernetes-integration-kubelet"></div>

### Collect Kubernetes metrics from kubelet API

Collecting metrics from the kubelet API is on by default.
Kubelet is an agent that runs on each Kubernetes node that is key to managing individual pods and the nodes that host them.
For more information on kubelet, refer to the Kubernetes [kubelet docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/).

((agent)) along with the Kubernetes integration can collect metrics from the kubelet API to gather important information about the state of your Kubernetes nodes, pods, containers, and other resources.
paleExpand the following list to see all available metrics from the kubelet API.

## Part 2: Configure and install the standalone ((agent))

After configuring your integration, you need to download and update your manifest. First, download the manifest by completing the following steps:

1. At the bottom of the **Add Kubernetes integration** page, click **Save and continue**.
1. Click **Add ((agent)) to your hosts**.
1. Under **Enroll in Fleet?**, select **Run standalone**.

    ![Select run standalone under Enroll in Fleet](images/run-standalone-option.png)

1. Under **Configure the agent**, select **Download Manifest**.

After downloading the manifest, open it and update the `ES_USERNAME` and `ES_PASSWORD` environment variables in the DaemonSet to match your ((es)) credentials.

You can also further modify the manifest to fit your needs. For example, you might want to enable autodiscovery to automatically discover container logs. Refer to the [autodiscovery docs](((fleet-guide))/elastic-agent-kubernetes-autodiscovery.html) in the ((fleet)) guide for more on enabling autodiscovery in your manifest.

Once you are ready to deploy your ((agent)):

1. From the directory where you've downloaded the manifest, run the following apply command:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f elastic-agent-standalone-kubernetes.yml
    ```

1. Check the ((agent)) status with the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l app=elastic-agent
    ```

Refer to [Debug standalone Elastic Agents](((fleet-guide))/debug-standalone-agents.html) if you run into any issues with configuring or installing your ((agent)).
