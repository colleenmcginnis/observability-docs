## Monitoring architecture

The ((stack)) provides the following components for monitoring Kubernetes:

1. ((agent)) is a single, unified way to add monitoring for data like logs and metrics to your host.

1. ((agent)) Kubernetes integration, in tandem with ((agent)), collects logs and metrics from Kubernetes clusters.

1. APM (described later) to monitor, detect, and diagnose complex application
    performance issues.

1. ((es)) for storing and searching your data.

1. ((observability)) apps in ((kib)) for visualizing and managing your observability data.

The default installation of ((agent)) is deployed to Kubernetes as a DaemonSet to ensure an instance is running on each node of the cluster.
It collects logs and metrics from pods, containers, and applications running on Kubernetes.

## Metadata

((agent)) provides processors for adding metadata to events. The
metadata is valuable for grouping and exploring related data. For example, when
analyzing container logs, you want to know the host and container name,
and be able to correlate logs, metrics, and traces.

The default deployments include processors, when needed, for enriching events
with cloud and host metadata.

For more on these processors, refer to the [`add_cloud_metadata`](((fleet-guide))/add-cloud-metadata-processor.html) and [`add_host_metadata`](((fleet-guide))/add_host_metadata-processor.html) documentation.

By default, the Kubernetes integration enriches logs and metrics with valuable metadata.

All Kubernetes metrics are enriched with metadata by default. The enrichment happens in code, and can be configured with the `add_resource_metadata` block on each dataset.
For more information on configuring the `add_resource_metadata` block, refer to \<\<monitor-k8s-kubelet-configure-metadata>> and \<\<monitor-k8s-kube-state-configure-metadata>>.

All Kubernetes logs are enriched with metadata by default. For more on configuring metadata enrichment, refer to \<\<monitor-kubernetes-integration-container-logs>>.

Now that you have a basic understanding of the monitoring architecture, let's learn how to deploy monitoring to your Kubernetes environment.

## Before you begin

Before you can monitor Kubernetes, you need the following:

* ((es)) for storing and searching your observability data and ((kib)) for visualizing and managing it.
* If you want to collect Kubernetes state metrics, you need to deploy `kube-state-metrics`.
