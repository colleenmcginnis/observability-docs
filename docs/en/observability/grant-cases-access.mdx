{/* lint ignore observability */}
To access and send cases to external systems, you need the [appropriate license](((subscriptions))),
and your role must have the **Cases** ((kib)) privilege as a user for the **((observability))** feature.

Here are the minimum required privileges:

  {
    "title": "Action",

    "title": "((kib)) Privileges",

  }
]}>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>
      Give full access to manage cases and settings

    </DocCell>
    <DocCell>

      * `All` for the **Cases** feature under **((observability))**.
      * `All` for the **((connectors-feature))** feature under **Management**.


      <DocCallOut title="Note">

      Roles without `All` **((connectors-feature))** feature privileges cannot create, add, delete, or modify case connectors.

      By default, `All` for the **Cases** feature includes authority to delete cases, delete alerts and comments from cases, and edit case settings unless you customize the sub-feature privileges.

      <DocCallOut title="Note">
      Before a user can be assigned to a case, they must log into ((kib)) at
      least once, which creates a user profile.

    <DocCell>
      Give view-only access for cases

      <DocCallOut title="Note">
      By default, `Read` for the **Cases** feature does not include authority to delete cases or delete alerts and comments from cases. You also cannot view or edit case settings. You can enable these actions by customizing the sub-feature privileges.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
If you are using an on-premises ((kib)) deployment and want your email
notifications and external incident management systems to contain links back
to ((kib)), configure the
[server.publicBaseUrl](((kibana-ref))/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl) setting.
