<div id="monitor-aws-elastic-agent"></div>

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to deploy ((agent)) and monitor your AWS
infrastructure with Elastic ((observability)).

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-what-you-learn"></div>

## What you'll learn

You'll learn how to:

* Collect VPC flow logs and S3 access logs from AWS.
* Collect billing and EC2 metrics from CloudWatch.
* Install and configure ((agent)) to stream the logs and metrics to ((es)).
* Visualize your data in ((kib)).

<DocCallOut title="Note">
For more use cases, check the [AWS integrations](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws).
</DocCallOut>

First you'll focus on monitoring logs, then you'll add metrics after you've confirmed
that your logs are streaming to ((es)).

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-before-you-begin"></div>

## Before you begin

Create a deployment using our hosted ((ess)) on [((ecloud))](((ess-trial))).
The deployment includes an ((es)) cluster for storing and searching your data,
and ((kib)) for visualizing and managing your data.

In this tutorial, we assume that:

* Your VPC flow logs are already exported to an S3 bucket. To learn how, refer
    to the AWS documentation about
    [publishing flow logs to an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-s3.html).

* You have EC2 instances in your AWS account. By default, Amazon EC2 sends
    metric data to CloudWatch. If you don’t have an EC2 instance in your account,
    refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
    to learn how to launch, connect to, and use a Linux instance.

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-set-up-sqs-queue-and-notifications"></div>

## Step 1: Create a queue and notifications for VPC flow logs

In this step, you create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue and
configure the S3 bucket containing your VPC flow logs to send a message to the
SQS queue whenever new logs are present in the S3 bucket.

You should already have an S3 bucket that contains exported VPC flow logs. If
you don't, create one now. To learn how, refer to
[publishing flow logs to an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-s3.html).

<DocCallOut>

**Why is an SQS queue needed?**

Creating an SQS queue helps avoid significant lagging caused by polling all log
files from each S3 bucket. Instead of polling each bucket, you configure the S3
buckets to send a notification to the SQS queue whenever a new object is
created. The ((agent)) monitors the SQS queue for new object creation messages and
uses information in the messages to retrieve logs from the S3 buckets. With this
setup, periodic polling from each S3 bucket is not needed. Instead, the ((agent))
S3 input guarantees near real-time data collection from S3 buckets with both
speed and reliability.

</DocCallOut>

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-create-sqs-queue"></div>

### Create an SQS queue

To create the SQS queue:

1. Go to the [SQS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and create an SQS
    queue. Create a standard SQS queue that uses the default settings.

    <DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

    Make sure you create the SQS queue in the same region as the S3 bucket.

    </DocCallOut>

1. Edit the queue you created and use a JSON object to define an advanced access
    policy. The access policy allows S3 ObjectCreated events to be sent to the
    queue.

    ```shell
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Id": "example-ID",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "example-statement-ID",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
          },
          "Action": "SQS:SendMessage",
          "Resource": "<sqs-arn>",  [^1]
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "aws:SourceAccount": "<source-account>"  [^2]
            },
            "ArnLike": {
              "aws:SourceArn": "<s3-bucket-arn>"  [^3]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    [^1]: Replace `<sqs-arn>` with the ARN of the SQS queue.
    [^2]: Replace `<source-account>` with your AWS account number.
    [^3]: Replace `<s3-bucket-arn>` with the ARN of the S3 bucket containing your VPC
    flow logs.

    Save your changes and make a note of the queue URL. You will need it later when
    you configure the AWS integration in ((kib)).

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-enable-event-notification"></div>

### Enable event notification on the S3 bucket

Now that your queue is created, go to the properties of the S3 bucket containing
the VPC flow logs and enable event notification:

1. Click **Create event notification**.

1. For the event type, select **All object create events** to send a notification
    for every object creation event.

1. For the destination, select the SQS queue you just created.

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-add-aws-integration"></div>

## Step 2: Install the AWS integration

In this step, you install the AWS integration in ((kib)). The AWS integration
contains inputs for collecting a variety of logs and metrics from AWS. You'll
start out by configuring the integration to collect VPC flow logs.
After you get that working, you'll learn how to add S3 access logs.

To add the integration:

1. Go to the ((kib)) home page and click **Add integrations**.

1. In the query bar, search for **AWS** and select the AWS integration to see
    more details about it.

1. Click **Add AWS**.

1. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    If you don't see options for configuring the integration, you're probably
    in a workflow designed for new deployments. Follow the steps, then return to
    this tutorial when you're ready to configure the integration.
    </DocCallOut>

1. Specify the AWS credentials required to connect to AWS and read log files.
    In this tutorial, we use an AWS access key ID and secret, but there are a few
    other ways to provide AWS credentials. To learn more, refer to the
    [AWS integration](((integrations-docs))/aws) documentation.
    The account you specify must have at least the following privileges:

    ```yml
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
            "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility",
            "sqs:DeleteMessage"
          ],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Turn off all data collection selectors _except_
    **Collect VPC flow logs from S3**.

1. Change defaults and in the **Queue URL** field, specify
    the URL of the SQS queue you created earlier.

1. Click **Save and continue**. This step takes a minute or two to complete. When
    it's done, you'll have an agent policy that contains the AWS configuration you
    just specified.

A popup should appear that prompts you to **Add ((agent)) to your hosts**.

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-install"></div>

## Step 3: Install and run an ((agent)) on your machine

You can install ((agent)) on any host that can access the AWS account and forward
events to ((es)).

1. In the popup, click **Add ((agent)) to your hosts** to open the **Add agent**
    flyout.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    If you accidentally closed the popup, go to **((fleet)) -> Agents**, then
    click **Add agent** to access the installation instructions.
    </DocCallOut>

    The **Add agent** flyout has two options: **Enroll in ((fleet))** and **Run
    standalone**. The default is to enroll the agents in ((fleet)), as this reduces
    the amount of work on the person managing the hosts by providing a centralized
    management tool in ((kib)).

1. The enrollment token you need should already be selected.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    The enrollment token is specific to the ((agent)) policy that you just
    created. When you run the command to enroll the agent in ((fleet)), you will pass
    in the enrollment token.
    </DocCallOut>

1. To download, install, and enroll the ((agent)), select your host operating
    system and copy the installation command shown in the instructions.

1. Run the command on the host where you want to install ((agent)).

It takes a few minutes for ((agent)) to enroll in ((fleet)), download the
configuration specified in the policy, and start collecting data. You can wait
to confirm incoming data, or close the window.

**What have you achieved so far?**

VPC flow logs are sent to an S3 bucket, which sends a notification to the SQS
queue. When ((agent)) detects a new message in the queue, it uses the information
in the message to retrieve flow logs from the S3 bucket. ((agent)) processes each
message, parses it into fields, and then sends the data to ((es)).

![Diagram of the current logging architecture for VPC flow logs](../../images/agent-tut-one-bucket-archi.png)

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-collect-s3-access-logs"></div>

## Step 4: Collect S3 access logs

<DocCallOut>

S3 access logs contain detailed records for the requests that are made to a
bucket. Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access
log information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help
you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill.

</DocCallOut>

Next, you'll collect S3 access logs generated by the bucket that contains VPC
flow logs. You could use any S3 bucket to generate S3 access logs, but to avoid
creating extra buckets in AWS, you'll use a bucket that already exists.

You create a new S3 bucket and queue for the access logs, then configure the
older S3 bucket to generate access logs.

When you're done, your monitoring architecture will look like this:

![Diagram of the logging architecture with access logging enabled](../../images/agent-tut-two-buckets-archi.png)

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-create-S3-bucket"></div>

### Create a bucket and queue for S3 access logs

To create the new bucket and queue for S3 access logs:

1. In the [AWS S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3), click
    **Create bucket**. Give the bucket a **name** and specify the **region** where
    you want it deployed.

    <DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

    Make sure you create the S3 bucket and SQS queue (next step) in the same region
    as the bucket containing VPC flow logs.

    </DocCallOut>

1. Follow the steps you learned earlier to create an SQS queue and edit the access
    policy (use the ARNs of the new S3 bucket and queue). Make a note of the queue
    URL because you will need it later when you configure S3 access log collection.

1. Configure the new S3 bucket to send notifications to the new queue when
    objects are created (follow the steps you learned earlier).

1. Go back to the old S3 bucket (the one that contains VPC flow logs), and under
    **Properties**, edit the **Server access logging** properties. Enable server
    access logging, and select the new bucket you created as the target bucket.

Now you're ready to edit the agent policy and configure S3 access log
collection.

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-configure-integration-accesslogs"></div>

### Configure the integration to collect S3 access logs

The ((agent)) you've deployed is already running and collecting VPC flow logs.
Now you need to edit the agent policy and configure the integration to collect
S3 access logs.

1. From the main menu in ((kib)), go to **((fleet)) -> Agents** and click the policy
    your agent is using.

1. Edit the AWS integration policy and turn on the
    **Collect S3 access logs from S3** selector.

1. In the **Queue URL** field, enter the URL of the SQS queue you created for
    S3 access log notifications, then save and deploy your changes.

It takes a few minutes for ((agent)) to update its configuration and start
collecting data.

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-visualize-logs"></div>

## Step 5: Visualize AWS logs

Now that logs are streaming into ((es)), you can visualize them in ((kib)). To see
the raw logs, open the main menu in ((kib)), then click **Logs**. Notice that you

can filter on a specific data stream. For example, set
`data_stream.dataset : "aws.s3access"` to show S3 access logs.

The AWS integration also comes with pre-built dashboards that you can use to
visualize the data. In ((kib)), open the main menu and click **Dashboard**. Search
for `VPC Flow` and select the dashboard called
**[Logs AWS] VPC Flow Log Overview**:

![Screenshot of the VPC Flow Log Overview dashboard](../../images/agent-tut-vpcflowlog-dashboard.png)

Next, open the dashboard called
**[Logs AWS] S3 Server Access Log Overview**:

![Screenshot of the S3 Server Access Log Overview dashboard](../../images/agent-tut-s3accesslog-dashboard.png)

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-collect-metrics"></div>

## Step 6: Collect AWS metrics

In this step, you configure the AWS integration to periodically fetch monitoring
metrics from AWS CloudWatch using **GetMetricData** API for AWS services.
Specifically you'll learn how to stream and process billing and EC2 metrics.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
Extra AWS charges on CloudWatch API requests may be generated if you
configure the AWS integration to collect metrics. To learn more, refer to the
[Amazon CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) page.
</DocCallOut>

1. Make sure the AWS account used to collect metrics from CloudWatch has at
    least the following permissions:

    ```yml
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Action": [
            "ec2:DescribeInstances",
            "ec2:DescribeRegions",
            "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
            "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
            "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
            "iam:ListAccountAliases",
            "tag:getResources",
            "ce:GetCostAndUsage"
          ],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. From the main menu in ((kib)), go to **((fleet)) -> Agents** and click the policy
    your agent is using.

1. Edit the AWS integration policy and turn on the **Collect billing metrics**
    selector. You can accept the defaults.

1. Also turn on the **Collect EC2 metrics** selector. Optionally change the
    defaults, then save and deploy your changes.

It takes a few minutes for ((agent)) to update its configuration and start
collecting data.

<div id="aws-elastic-agent-visualize-metrics"></div>

## Step 7: Visualize AWS metrics

Now that the metrics are streaming into ((es)), you can visualize them in ((kib)).
In ((kib)), open the main menu and click **Discover**. Select the `metrics-*`
data view, then filter on `data_stream.dataset: "aws.ec2_metrics"`:

![Screenshot of the Discover app showing EC2 metrics](../../images/agent-tut-ec2-metrics-discover.png)

The AWS integration also comes with pre-built dashboards that you can use to
visualize the data. In ((kib)), open the main menu and click **Dashboard**.

Search for EC2 and select the dashboard called **[Metrics AWS] EC2 Overview**:

![Screenshot of the EC2 Overview dashboard](../../images/agent-tut-ec2-overview-dashboard.png)

To track your AWS billing, open the
**[Metrics AWS] Billing Overview** dashboard:

![Screenshot of the Billing Overview dashboard](../../images/agent-tut-billing-dashboard.png)
