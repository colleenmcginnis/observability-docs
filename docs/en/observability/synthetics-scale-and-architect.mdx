Use these advanced considerations when using the ((synthetics-app))
for large and complex use cases.

## Do not use the ((synthetics-app)) with CCS/CCR

In complex environments it's common to have multiple task-specific ((stack))
deployments with one  centralized overview cluster using CCS or CCR to centralize ((kib))
dashboards and apps. **Do not use this pattern with the ((synthetics-app))**.
Instead, configure your synthetic monitors directly on the ((kib)) instance where you
want to view and manage them.

You may, however, use Dashboards and the Discover feature with CCS to view `synthetics-*` indices.

The ((synthetics-app)) does _not_ work with CCS/CCR because it would limit the rich
user experience that the ((synthetics-app)) provides.
Unlike the majority of ((kib)) apps, the ((synthetics-app)) relies heavily on state stored
in ((kib)) shared objects in order to provide a rich user experience.
Because ((kib)) saved objects cannot be shared via CCS/CCR, the ((synthetics-app))
will not show any user data even if CCS/CCR is configured.

## Manage large numbers of Synthetic monitors with tags

When managing larger numbers of synthetic monitors, use tags to keep them organized.
Many of the views in the ((synthetics-app)) are tag-aware and can group data by tag.

## Create custom dashboards

If the ((synthetics-app)) does not provide a UI for your exact needs, you can use 
[((kib)) dashboards](((kibana-ref))/dashboard.html) to build custom visualizations.
For a complete accounting of fields used by the ((synthetics-app)), refer to
[((heartbeat))'s exported fields](((heartbeat-ref))/exported-fields.html).
