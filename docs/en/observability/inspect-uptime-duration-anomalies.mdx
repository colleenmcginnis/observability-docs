<div id="inspect-uptime-duration-anomalies"></div>

Each monitor location is modeled, and when a monitor runs
for an unusual amount of time, at a particular time, an anomaly is recorded and highlighted
on the **Monitor duration** chart.

<div id="uptime-anomaly-detection"></div>

## Enable uptime duration ((anomaly-detect))

Create a ((ml)) job to detect anomalous monitor duration rates automatically.

{/* lint disable observability anomaly-detection */}
1. To access this page, go to **Observability > Uptime > Monitors**, and then click a monitor to view its the details.
1. In the **Monitor duration** panel, click **Enable anomaly detection**.

<DocCallOut title="Note">

If ((anomaly-detect)) is already enabled, click **Anomaly detection** and select to view duration anomalies directly in the
[((ml-app)) app](((ml-docs))/ml-gs-results.html), enable an <DocLink slug="/en/observability/duration-anomaly-alert">anomaly rule</DocLink>,
or disable the ((anomaly-detect)).

</DocCallOut>

1. You are prompted to create a <DocLink slug="/en/observability/duration-anomaly-alert">response duration anomaly rule</DocLink> for the ((ml)) job which will carry
    out the analysis, and you can configure which severity level to create the rule for.
    {/* lint enable observability anomaly-detection */}

When an anomaly is detected, the duration is displayed on the **Monitor duration**
chart, along with the duration times. The colors represent the criticality of the anomaly: red
(critical) and yellow (minor).
