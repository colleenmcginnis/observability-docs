<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
To minimize the privileges required by the writer role, use the
<DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsRoleSetup">setup role</DocLink> to enable Monitor Management.
This section assumes another user has already enabled Monitor Management.
</DocCallOut>

For users who need to create, modify, and delete monitors, provide write access.
Two types of write access are outlined below:

* **General write access**: For most users, you can use <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsRoleWrite" section="general-write-access">General write access</DocLink>,
    which grants write access to all ((kib)) apps and requires little configuration.

* **Limited write access**: If you want to limit write access to the ((synthetics-app)) only,
    you can use <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsRoleWrite" section="limited-write-access">Limited write access</DocLink>, which requires additional configuration.

<div id="synthetics-write-privileges-general"></div>

## General write access

Create a **writer role**, called something like `synthetics_writer`:

1. Start with the `editor` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html).
    This role grants full access to all features in ((kib)) (including the ((observability)) solution)
    and read-only access to data indices.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
The `editor` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html) will grant write access
to _all_ ((kib)) apps. If you want to limit write access to the ((synthetics-app)) only,
refer to <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsRoleWrite" section="limited-write-access">Limited write access</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>

1. _If the user should have permission to create, modify, and delete project monitors_,
    they will need an API key that can be used to `push` monitors.
    To create API keys, the user will also need _at least one_ of the following privileges in addition to the
    privileges included in the `editor` built-in role:

    | Type | Privilege | Purpose |
    |---|---|---|
    | [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_own_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on ((es)) API keys that are owned by the current authenticated user. |
    | [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_security` | Allows access to all security-related operations such as CRUD operations on users and roles and cache clearing. |
    | [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on ((es)) API keys. |

<div id="synthetics-write-privileges-limited"></div>

## Limited write access

If you want to limit write access to the ((synthetics-app)) only, do _not_ use the
`editor` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html).

Instead to you can create a writer role, called something like `synthetics_writer_limited`,
and start by granting the following privileges:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `synthetics-*`: `read` | Read-only access to synthetics indices. |
| [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `.alerts-observability.uptime.alerts-*`: `read` | Read-only access to synthetics alert indices. |
| [Kibana](((kibana-ref))/kibana-privileges.html) | `Synthetics and Uptime`: `All` | Access to the ((synthetics-app)) in ((kib)). |

Additional privileges will depend on the factors below.

<div id="disable-managed-locations"></div>

### To restrict using Elastic's global managed infrastructure

To restrict users assigned this role from using monitors hosted on Elastic's global managed infrastructure:

1. Expand `Synthetics and Uptime` in the list of [Kibana](((kibana-ref))/kibana-privileges.html) privileges.
1. Toggle _Customize sub-feature privileges_.
1. Uncheck _Elastic managed locations enabled_.

<div id="synthetics-role-write-private-locations"></div>

### If using Private Locations

The user who initially sets up a new Private Location needs additional privileges. Users who create or update monitors hosted on that Private Location do not need any additional permissions.

The user who is setting up a new Private Location will need the following privileges when creating the agent policy in ((fleet)):

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [Kibana](((kibana-ref))/kibana-privileges.html) | `Fleet`: `All` | Access to Fleet in ((kib)). |
| [Kibana](((kibana-ref))/kibana-privileges.html) | `Integrations`: `read` | Access to Integrations in ((kib)). |

<div id="if_using_projects"></div>

### If using projects

If the user should be able to create and update monitors using
<DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsGetStarted" section="((project-monitors-cap))">projects</DocLink>, add _at least one_ of following privileges:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_own_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on ((es)) API keys that are owned by the current authenticated user. |
| [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_security` | Allows access to all security-related operations such as CRUD operations on users and roles and cache clearing. |
| [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on ((es)) API keys. |
