Configure ((kib)) to enable the Universal Profiling plugin with the following configuration:

```yaml
xpack.profiling.enabled: true
```

Refer to the steps for your platform to deploy update the configuration.

<div id="ece"></div>

## ECE

Install the 8.12.0 stackpack or higher.
Refer to [ECE manage elastic stack](((ece-ref))/ece-manage-elastic-stack.html#ece-manage-elastic-stack) for more information.

In ECE, you don't need to perform any additional steps to enable the Universal Profiling plugin in Kibana.

## Self-managed Elastic stack

1. Edit the Kibana YAML configuration file, usually named `kibana.yml` by adding previous configuration line.
1. Restart Kibana to reload the configuration.

<div id="kubernetes"></div>

## Kubernetes

If you're using ECK, add the previous configuration line to the `kibana.k8s.elastic.co/v1` CRD, placing it under the `spec.config` key.
Refer to the [ECK documentation](((eck-ref))/k8s-kibana-advanced-configuration.html#k8s-kibana-configuration) for more on configuring ((kib)).

If you're not using ECK, edit the `secret` or `configMap` holding the `kibana.yml` configuration file.
Add the previously mentioned config line, and then perform a rolling restart of the Kibana deployment to reload the configuration.
