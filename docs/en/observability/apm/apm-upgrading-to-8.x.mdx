## Notable APM changes

* All index management has been removed from APM Server;
    ((fleet)) is now entirely responsible for setting up index templates, index lifecycle polices,
    and index pipelines.

* APM Server now only writes to well-defined data streams;
    writing to classic indices is no longer supported.

* APM Server has a new ((es)) output implementation with defaults that should be sufficient for
    most use cases.

As a result of the above changes,
a number of index management and index tuning configuration variables have been removed.
See the APM <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmReleaseNotes">release notes</DocLink>, <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmBreaking">breaking changes</DocLink> for full details.
