<div id="apm-bad-request"></div>

## HTTP 400: Data decoding error / Data validation error

The most likely cause for this error is using incompatible versions of ((apm-agent)) and APM Server.
See the <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmAgentServerCompatibility">agent/server compatibility matrix</DocLink> to verify compatibility.

<div id="apm-event-too-large"></div>

## HTTP 400: Event too large

APM agents communicate with the APM server by sending events in an HTTP request. Each event is sent as its own line in the HTTP request body. If events are too large, you should consider increasing the <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationProcess" section="max-event-size">Max event size</DocLink>
setting in the APM integration, and adjusting relevant settings in the agent.

<div id="apm-unauthorized"></div>

## HTTP 401: Invalid token

Either the <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmSecretToken">Secret token</DocLink> in the request header doesn't match the secret token configured in the APM integration,
or the <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmApiKey">API keys</DocLink> is invalid.

<div id="apm-forbidden"></div>

## HTTP 403: Forbidden request

Either you are sending requests to a <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmRum">RUM</DocLink> endpoint without RUM enabled, or a request
is coming from an origin not specified in the APM integration settings.
See the <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationRum" section="allowed-origins">Allowed origins</DocLink> setting for more information.

<div id="apm-request-timed-out"></div>

## HTTP 503: Request timed out waiting to be processed

This happens when APM Server exceeds the maximum number of requests that it can process concurrently.
To alleviate this problem, you can try to: reduce the sample rate and/or reduce the collected stack trace information.
See <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmReduceApmStorage">Reduce storage</DocLink> for more information.

Another option is to increase processing power.
This can be done by either migrating your ((agent)) to a more powerful machine
or adding more APM Server instances.
