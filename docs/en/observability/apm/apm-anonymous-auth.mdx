<div id="apm-anonymous-auth"></div>

Elastic APM agents can send unauthenticated (anonymous) events to the APM Server.
An event is considered to be anonymous if no authentication token can be extracted from the incoming request.
The APM Server's default response to these these requests depends on its configuration:

| Configuration | Default |
|---|---|
| An <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-api-key">API key</DocLink> or <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-secret-token">secret token</DocLink> is configured | Anonymous requests are rejected and an authentication error is returned. |
| No API key or secret token is configured | Anonymous requests are accepted by the APM Server. |

In some cases, however, it makes sense to allow both authenticated and anonymous requests.
For example, it isn't possible to authenticate requests from front-end services as
the secret token or API key can't be protected. This is the case with the Real User Monitoring (RUM)
agent running in a browser, or the Android or iOS/Swift agent running in a user application.
However, you still likely want to authenticate requests from back-end services.
To solve this problem, you can enable anonymous authentication in the APM Server to allow the
ingestion of unauthenticated client-side APM data while still requiring authentication for server-side services.

## Configuring anonymous auth for client-side services

<DocCallOut title="Note">

You can only enable and configure anonymous authentication if an <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-api-key">API key</DocLink> or
<DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-secret-token">secret token</DocLink> is configured. If neither are configured, these settings will be ignored.

## Deriving an incoming request's `client.ip` address

The remote IP address of an incoming request might be different
from the end-user's actual IP address, for example, because of a proxy. For this reason,
the APM Server attempts to derive the IP address of an incoming request from HTTP headers.
The supported headers are parsed in the following order:

1. `Forwarded`
1. `X-Real-Ip`
1. `X-Forwarded-For`

If none of these headers are present, the remote address for the incoming request is used.

### Using a reverse proxy or load balancer

HTTP headers are easily modified;
it's possible for anyone to spoof the derived `client.ip` value by changing or setting,
for example, the value of the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
For this reason, if any of your clients are not trusted,
we recommend setting up a reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the APM Server.

Using a proxy allows you to clear any existing IP-forwarding HTTP headers,
and replace them with one set by the proxy.
This prevents malicious users from cycling spoofed IP addresses to bypass the
APM Server's rate limiting feature.
