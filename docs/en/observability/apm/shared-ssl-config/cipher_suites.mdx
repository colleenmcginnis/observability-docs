Here is a list of acronyms used in defining the cipher suites:

* 3DES:
    Cipher suites using triple DES

* AES-128/256:
    Cipher suites using AES with 128/256-bit keys.

* CBC:
    Cipher using Cipher Block Chaining as block cipher mode.

* ECDHE:
    Cipher suites using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (DH) ephemeral key exchange.

* ECDSA:
    Cipher suites using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for authentication.

* GCM:
    Galois/Counter mode is used for symmetric key cryptography.

* RC4:
    Cipher suites using RC4.

* RSA:
    Cipher suites using RSA.

* SHA, SHA256, SHA384:
