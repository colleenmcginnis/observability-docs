<div id="apm-api-span-schema"></div>

## Span Schema

APM Server uses JSON Schema to validate requests. The specification for spans is defined on
[GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/((minor-version))/docs/spec/v2/span.json) and included below:

```json
include::\(\(apm-server-root))/docs/spec/v2/span.json[]
```
