<div id="apm-secure-agent-communication"></div>

Communication between APM agents and ((agent)) can be both encrypted and authenticated.
It is strongly recommended to use both TLS encryption and authentication as secrets are sent as plain text.

* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-api-key">API key authentication</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-secret-token">Secret token authentication</DocLink>

As soon as an authenticated communication is enabled,
requests without a valid token or API key will be denied.
If both API keys and a secret token are enabled, APM agents can choose whichever mechanism they support.

In some use-cases, like when an ((apm-agent)) is running on the client side,
authentication is not possible. See <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-anonymous-auth">Anonymous authentication</DocLink> for more information.
