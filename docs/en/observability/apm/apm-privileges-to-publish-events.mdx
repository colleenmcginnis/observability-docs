<div id="apm-privileges-to-publish-events"></div>

APM users that publish events to ((es)) need privileges to write to APM data streams.

<div id="general_writer_role"></div>

## General writer role

To grant an APM user the required privileges for writing events to ((es)):

1. Create a **general writer role**, called something like `apm_writer`,
    that has the following privileges:

    | Type | Privilege | Purpose |
    |---|---|---|
    | Index | `auto_configure` on `traces-apm*`, `logs-apm*`, and `metrics-apm*` indices | Permits auto-creation of indices and data streams |
    | Index | `create_doc` on `traces-apm*`, `logs-apm*`, and `metrics-apm*` indices | Write events into ((es)) |

1. Assign the **general writer role** to users who need to publish APM data.

1. If <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-configuration-rum">real user monitoring</DocLink> is enabled, create a separate <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-rum-source-map" section="apm-server-rum-source-mapping">RUM source mapping role</DocLink>.
