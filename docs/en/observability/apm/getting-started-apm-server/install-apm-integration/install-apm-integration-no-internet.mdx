If your environment has network traffic restrictions, there are other ways to install the APM integration.
See [Air-gapped environments](((fleet-guide))/air-gapped.html) for more information.

Option 1: Update `kibana.yml`

    Update `kibana.yml` to include the following, then restart ((kib)).

    ```yaml
    xpack.fleet.packages:
      - name: apm
        version: latest
    ```

    See [Configure Kibana](((kibana-ref))/settings.html) to learn more about how to edit the Kibana configuration file.

Option 2: Use the ((fleet)) API

    Use the ((fleet)) API to install the APM integration. To be successful, this needs to be run against the ((kib))
    API, not the ((es)) API.

    ```yaml
    POST kbn:/api/fleet/epm/packages/apm/((apm_server_version))
    { "force": true }
    ```

    See [Kibana API](((kibana-ref))/api.html) to learn more about how to use the Kibana APIs.
