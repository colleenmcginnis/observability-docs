Use role-based access control or API keys to grant APM Server users access to secured resources.

After privileged users have been created, use authentication to connect to a secured Elastic cluster.

## Security Overview

APM Server exposes an HTTP endpoint, and as with anything that opens ports on your servers,
you should be careful about who can connect to it.
Firewall rules are recommended to ensure only authorized systems can connect.

## Feature roles

You can use role-based access control to grant users access to secured
resources. The roles that you set up depend on your organization's security
requirements and the minimum privileges required to use specific features.

Typically, you need to create the following separate roles:

* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-to-publish-events">Writer role</DocLink>: To publish events collected by APM Server.
* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-to-publish-monitoring">Monitoring role</DocLink>: One for sending monitoring
    information, and another for viewing it.

* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-api-key">API key role</DocLink>: To create and manage API keys.
* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-agent-central-config">Central configuration management role</DocLink>: To view
    APM Agent central configurations.

* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-rum-source-map" section="apm-server-rum-source-mapping">RUM source mapping role</DocLink>: To read RUM source maps.

((es-security-features)) provides [built-in roles](((ref))/built-in-roles.html) that grant a
subset of the privileges needed by APM users.
When possible, assign users the built-in roles to minimize the affect of future changes on your security strategy.
If no built-in role is available, you can assign users the privileges needed to accomplish a specific task.
In general, there are three types of privileges you'll work with:

* **((es)) cluster privileges**: Manage the actions a user can perform against your cluster.
* **((es)) index privileges**: Control access to the data in specific indices your cluster.
* **((kib)) space privileges**: Grant users write or read access to features and apps within ((kib)).
