Transactions are events corresponding to an incoming request or similar task occurring in a monitored service.

<div id="apm-api-transaction-schema"></div>

## Transaction Schema

APM Server uses JSON Schema to validate requests. The specification for transactions is defined on
[GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/((minor-version))/docs/spec/v2/transaction.json) and included below:

```json
include::\(\(apm-server-root))/docs/spec/v2/transaction.json[]
```
