If no data shows up in ((es)), first check that the APM components are properly connected.

To ensure that APM Server configuration is valid and it can connect to the configured output, ((es)) by default,
run the following commands:

```sh
apm-server test config
apm-server test output
```

To see if the agent can connect to the APM Server, send requests to the instrumented service and look for lines
containing `[request]` in the APM Server logs.

If no requests are logged, it might be that SSL is <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-common-problems" section="ssl-client-fails-to-connect">misconfigured</DocLink> or that the host is wrong.
Particularly, if you are using Docker, ensure to bind to the right interface (for example, set
`apm-server.host = 0.0.0.0:8200` to match any IP) and set the `SERVER_URL` setting in the agent accordingly.

If you see requests coming through the APM Server but they are not accepted (response code other than `202`), consider
the response code to narrow down the possible causes (see sections below).

Another reason for data not showing up is that the agent is not auto-instrumenting something you were expecting, check
the [agent documentation](((apm-agents-ref))/index.html) for details on what is automatically instrumented.

APM Server currently relies on ((es)) to create indices that do not exist.
As a result, ((es)) must be configured to allow [automatic index creation](((ref))/docs-index_.html#index-creation) for APM indices.
