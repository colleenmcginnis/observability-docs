To achieve high availability
you can place multiple instances of APM Server behind a regular HTTP load balancer,
for example HAProxy or Nginx.

The endpoint `/` always returns an `HTTP 200`.
You can configure your load balancer to send HTTP requests to this endpoint
to determine if an APM Server is running.
See <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmApiInfo">APM Server information API</DocLink> for more information on that endpoint.

In case of temporal issues, like unavailable ((es)) or a sudden high workload,
APM Server does not have an internal queue to buffer requests,
but instead leverages an HTTP request timeout to act as back-pressure.

If ((es)) goes down, the APM Server will eventually deny incoming requests.
Both the APM Server and ((apm-agent))(s) will issue logs accordingly.
