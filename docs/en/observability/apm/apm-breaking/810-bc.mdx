### 8.10

The following breaking changes are introduced in APM version 8.10.0:

- Aggregated metrics now consider global labels to be part of a service's identity, and high cardinality global labels may cause services to be obscured.
For more details, see [PR #11386](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/11386).

- Event protobuf encoding for tail-based sampling changed to a more efficient encoding for event timestamp and duration
For more details, see [PR #11386](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/11386).
