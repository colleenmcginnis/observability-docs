### 8.6

The following breaking changes and deprecations are introduced in APM version 8.6.0:

<div id="`apm-server.decoder.*`_no_longer_recorded"></div>

#### `apm-server.decoder.*` no longer recorded
The stack monitoring metrics, `apm-server.decoder.*`, are no longer recorded.
These metrics were not used by stack monitoring, so there should be no noticeable change.

For more details, see [PR #9210](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/9210).

<div id="`context.http.response.*_size`_fields_now_enforce_integer_values"></div>

#### `context.http.response.*_size` fields now enforce integer values
New field mappings enforce integer values for `context.http.response.*_size`.
The fields are mapped with `index: false` to minimize storage overhead.

For more details, see [PR #9429](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/9429).

<div id="`observer.id`_and_`observer.ephemeral_id`_removed"></div>

#### `observer.id` and `observer.ephemeral_id` removed

`observer.id` and `observer.ephemeral_id` are no longer added to APM documents.
The APM UI does not currently rely on these field, so there should be no noticeable change.

For more details, see [PR #9412](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/9412).

<div id="`timeseries.instance`_removed"></div>

#### `timeseries.instance` removed
`timeseries.instance` has been removed from transaction metrics docs.
The APM UI did not use this field, so there should be no noticeable change.

For more details, see [PR #9565](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/9565).
