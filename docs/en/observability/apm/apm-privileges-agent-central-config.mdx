## APM Server agent central configuration management

APM Server acts as a proxy between your APM agents and the ((apm-app)).
The ((apm-app)) communicates any changed settings to APM Server so that your agents only need to poll the Server
to determine which central configuration settings have changed.

To grant an APM Server user with the required privileges for managing central configuration in ((es)) without ((kib)),
assign the user the following privileges:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Index | `read` on `.apm-agent-configuration` index, `allow_restricted_indices: true` | Allow APM Server to manage central configurations in ((es)) |

The above privileges should be sufficient for APM agent central configuration to work properly
as long as APM Server communicates with ((es)) successfully.
If it fails, it may fallback to read agent central configuration via ((kib)) if configured,
which requires the following privileges:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Spaces | `Read` on ((apm-app)) | Allow APM Server to manage central configurations via the ((apm-app)) |
