In a production environment, you would put APM Server on its own machines,
similar to how you run ((es)).
You _can_ run it on the same machines as ((es)), but this is not recommended,
as the processes will be competing for resources.

To start APM Server, run:

```bash
./apm-server -e
```

<DocCallOut title="Note">
The `-e` <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-command-line-options" section="global-flags">global flag</DocLink> enables logging to stderr and disables syslog/file output.
Remove this flag if you've enabled logging in the configuration file.
For Linux systems, see <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-running-with-systemd">APM Server status and logs</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>

You should see APM Server start up.
It will try to connect to ((es)) on localhost port `9200` and expose an API to agents on port `8200`.
You can change the defaults in `apm-server.yml` or by supplying a different address on the command line:

```bash
./apm-server -e -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=ElasticsearchAddress:9200 -E apm-server.host=localhost:8200
```

## Debian Package / RPM

For Debian package and RPM installations, we recommend the `apm-server` process runs as a non-root user.
Therefore, these installation methods create an `apm-server` user which you can use to start the process.
In addition, APM Server will only start if the configuration file is
\<\<apm-config-file-ownership,owned by the user running the process>>.

To start the APM Server in this case, run:

```bash
sudo -u apm-server apm-server [<argument...>]
```

By default, APM Server loads its configuration file from `/etc/apm-server/apm-server.yml`.
