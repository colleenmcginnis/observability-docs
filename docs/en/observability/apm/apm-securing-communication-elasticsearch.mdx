## Secure communication with ((es))

When sending data to a secured cluster through the `elasticsearch`
output, APM Server can use any of the following authentication methods:

* Basic authentication credentials (username and password).
* Token-based API authentication.
* A client certificate.

Authentication is specified in the APM Server configuration file:

* To use **basic authentication**, specify the `username` and `password` settings under `output.elasticsearch`.
    For example:

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
    username: "apm_writer"  [^1]
    password: "((pwd))"
    ```
    [^1]: This user needs the privileges required to publish events to ((es)).
    To create a user like this, see <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-to-publish-events">Grant privileges and roles needed for writing events</DocLink>.

* To use token-based **API key authentication**, specify the `api_key` under `output.elasticsearch`.
    For example:

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
    api_key: "KnR6yE41RrSowb0kQ0HWoA"  [^1]
    ```
    [^1]: This API key must have the privileges required to publish events to ((es)).
    To create an API key like this, see <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-beats-api-keys">Grant access using API keys</DocLink>.

* To use **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates** to authenticate users,
    specify the `certificate` and `key` settings under `output.elasticsearch`.
    For example:

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
    ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"  [^1]
    ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"  [^2]
    ```
    [^1]: The path to the certificate for SSL client authentication
    [^2]: The client certificate key

    These settings assume that the
    distinguished name (DN) in the certificate is mapped to the appropriate roles in
    the `role_mapping.yml` file on each node in the ((es)) cluster. For more
    information, see [Using role
    mapping files](((ref))/mapping-roles.html#mapping-roles-file).

    By default, APM Server uses the list of trusted certificate authorities (CA) from the
    operating system where APM Server is running. If the certificate authority that signed your node certificates
    is not in the host system's trusted certificate authorities list, you need
    to add the path to the `.pem` file that contains your CA's certificate to the
    APM Server configuration. This will configure APM Server to use a specific list of
    CA certificates instead of the default list from the OS.

    Here is an example configuration:

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["https://myEShost:9200"]
    ssl.certificate_authorities:  [^1]
    - /etc/pki/my_root_ca.pem
    - /etc/pki/my_other_ca.pem
    ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client.pem"  [^2]
    ssl.key: "/etc/pki/key.pem"  [^3]
    ```
    [^1]: Specify the path to the local `.pem` file that contains your Certificate
    Authority's certificate. This is needed if you use your own CA to sign your node certificates.
    [^2]: The path to the certificate for SSL client authentication
    [^3]: The client certificate key

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    For any given connection, the SSL/TLS certificates must have a subject
    that matches the value specified for `hosts`, or the SSL handshake fails.
    For example, if you specify `hosts: ["foobar:9200"]`, the certificate MUST
    include `foobar` in the subject (`CN=foobar`) or as a subject alternative name
    (SAN). Make sure the hostname resolves to the correct IP address. If no DNS is available, then
    you can associate the IP address with your hostname in `/etc/hosts`
    (on Unix) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (on Windows).

### Secure communication with the ((kib)) endpoint

If you've configured the <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-setup-kibana-endpoint">((kib)) endpoint</DocLink>,
you can also specify credentials for authenticating with ((kib)) under `kibana.setup`.
If no credentials are specified, ((kib)) will use the configured authentication method
in the ((es)) output.

For example, specify a unique username and password to connect to ((kib)) like this:

```yaml
setup.kibana:
  host: "mykibanahost:5601"
  username: "apm_kib_setup"  [^1]
  password: "((pwd))"
```
[^1]: This user needs privileges required to set up dashboards
