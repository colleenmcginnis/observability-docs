**If ((es)) is down**

APM Server does not have an internal queue to buffer requests,
but instead leverages an HTTP request timeout to act as back-pressure.
If ((es)) goes down, the APM Server will eventually deny incoming requests.
Both the APM Server and ((apm-agent))(s) will issue logs accordingly.

**If APM Server is down**

Some agents have internal queues or buffers that will temporarily store data if the APM Server goes down.
As a general rule of thumb, queues fill up quickly. Assume data will be lost if APM Server goes down.
Adjusting these queues/buffers can increase the agent's overhead, so use caution when updating default values.

{/* * **Android agent** - ?? */}
* **Go agent** - Circular buffer with configurable size: [`ELASTIC_APM_BUFFER_SIZE`](((apm-go-ref))/configuration.html#config-api-buffer-size).
{/* * **iOS agent** - ?? */}
* **Java agent** - Internal buffer with configurable size: [`max_queue_size`](((apm-java-ref))/config-reporter.html#config-max-queue-size).
* **Node.js agent** - No internal queue. Data is lost.
* **PHP agent** - No internal queue. Data is lost.
* **Python agent** - Internal [Transaction queue](((apm-py-ref))/tuning-and-overhead.html#tuning-queue) with configurable size and time between flushes.
* **Ruby agent** - Internal queue with configurable size: [`api_buffer_size`](((apm-ruby-ref))/configuration.html#config-api-buffer-size).
* **RUM agent** - No internal queue. Data is lost.
* **.NET agent** - No internal queue. Data is lost.
