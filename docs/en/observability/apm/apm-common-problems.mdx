<div id="apm-no-data-indexed"></div>

## No data is indexed

If no data shows up in ((es)), first make sure that your APM components are properly connected.

<NoDataIndexedWidget />

<div id="apm-data-indexed-no-apm"></div>

## Data is indexed but doesn't appear in the APM app

The ((apm-app)) relies on index mappings to query and display data.
If your APM data isn't showing up in the ((apm-app)), but is elsewhere in ((kib)), like the Discover app,
you may have a missing index mapping.

You can determine if a field was mapped correctly with the `_mapping` API.
For example, run the following command in the ((kib)) [console](((kibana-ref))/console-kibana.html).
This will display the field data type of the `service.name` field.

```curl
GET *apm*/_mapping/field/service.name
```

If the `mapping.name.type` is `"text"`, your APM indices were not set up correctly.

```yml
".ds-metrics-apm.transaction.1m-default-2023.04.12-000038": {
   "mappings": {
      "service.name": {
         "full_name": "service.name",
         "mapping": {
            "name": {
               "type": "text"  [^1]
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```
[^1]: The `service.name` `mapping.name.type` would be `"keyword"` if this field had been set up correctly.

To fix this problem, install the APM integration by following these steps:

<InstallApmIntegration />

This will reinstall the APM index templates and trigger a data stream index rollover.

You can verify the correct index templates were installed by running the following command in the ((kib)) console:

```curl
GET /_index_template/traces-apm
```

<div id="apm-ssl-client-fails"></div>

### SSL client fails to connect

The target host might be unreachable or the certificate may not be valid.
To fix this problem:

1. Make sure that the APM Server process on the target host is running and you can connect to it.
    Try to ping the target host to verify that you can reach it from the host running APM Server.
    Then use either `nc` or `telnet` to make sure that the port is available. For example:

    ```shell
    ping <hostname or IP>
    telnet <hostname or IP> 5044
    ```

1. Verify that the certificate is valid and that the hostname and IP match.
1. Use OpenSSL to test connectivity to the target server and diagnose problems.
    See the [OpenSSL documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-s_client.html) for more info.

<div id="apm-cannot-validate-certificate"></div>

### x509: cannot validate certificate for `<IP address>` because it doesn't contain any IP SANs

This happens because your certificate is only valid for the hostname present in the Subject field.
To resolve this problem, try one of these solutions:

* Create a DNS entry for the hostname, mapping it to the server's IP.
* Create an entry in `/etc/hosts` for the hostname. Or, on Windows, add an entry to
    `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

* Re-create the server certificate and add a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for the IP address of the server. This makes the
    server's certificate valid for both the hostname and the IP address.

<div id="apm-getsockopt-no-route-to-host"></div>

### getsockopt: no route to host

This is not an SSL problem. It's a networking problem. Make sure the two hosts can communicate.

<div id="apm-getsockopt-connection-refused"></div>

### getsockopt: connection refused

This is not an SSL problem. Make sure that ((ls)) is running and that there is no firewall blocking the traffic.

<div id="apm-target-machine-refused-connection"></div>

### No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it

A firewall is refusing the connection. Check if a firewall is blocking the traffic on the client, the network, or the
destination host.

<div id="apm-io-timeout"></div>

## I/O Timeout

I/O Timeouts can occur when your timeout settings across the stack are not configured correctly,
especially when using a load balancer.

You may see an error like the one below in the ((apm-agent)) logs, and/or a similar error on the APM Server side:

```logs
[ElasticAPM] APM Server responded with an error:
"read tcp 123.34.22.313:8200->123.34.22.40:41602: i/o timeout"
```

To fix this, ensure timeouts are incrementing from the ((apm-agent)),
through your load balancer, to the APM Server.

By default, the agent timeouts are set at 10 seconds, and the server timeout is set at 3600 seconds.
Your load balancer should be set somewhere between these numbers.

For example:

```txt
APM agent --> Load Balancer  --> APM Server
   10s            15s               3600s
```

The APM Server timeout can be configured by updating the
<DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-configuration-process" section="read-timeout">maximum duration for reading an entire request</DocLink>.

<div id="apm-field-limit-exceeded"></div>

## Field limit exceeded

When adding too many distinct tag keys on a transaction or span,
you risk creating a [mapping explosion](((ref))/mapping.html#mapping-limit-settings).

For example, you should avoid that user-specified data,
like URL parameters, is used as a tag key.
Likewise, using the current timestamp or a user ID as a tag key is not a good idea.
However, tag **values** with a high cardinality are not a problem.
Just try to keep the number of distinct tag keys at a minimum.

The symptom of a mapping explosion is that transactions and spans are not indexed anymore after a certain time. Usually, on the next day,
the spans and transactions will be indexed again because a new index is created each day.
But as soon as the field limit is reached, indexing stops again.

In the agent logs, you won't see a sign of failures as the APM server asynchronously sends the data it received from the agents to ((es)). However, the APM server and ((es)) log a warning like this:

```logs
{\"type\":\"illegal_argument_exception\",\"reason\":\"Limit of total fields [1000] in [INDEX_NAME] has been exceeded\"}
```

<div id="apm-tail-based-sampling-memory-disk-io"></div>

## Tail-based sampling causing high system memory usage and high disk IO

Tail-based sampling requires minimal memory to run, and there should not be a noticeable increase in RSS memory usage.
However, since tail-based sampling writes data to disk,
it is possible to see a significant increase in OS page cache memory usage due to disk IO.
If you see a drop in throughput and excessive disk activity after enabling tail-based sampling,
please ensure that there is enough memory headroom in the system for OS page cache to perform disk IO efficiently.
