APM data follows the `<type>-<dataset>-<namespace>` naming scheme.
The `type` and `dataset` are predefined by the APM integration,
but the `namespace` is your opportunity to customize how different types of data are stored in ((es)).
There is no recommendation for what to use as your namespace--it is intentionally flexible.
For example, you might create namespaces for each of your environments,
like `dev`, `prod`, `production`, etc.
Or, you might create namespaces that correspond to strategic business units within your organization.
