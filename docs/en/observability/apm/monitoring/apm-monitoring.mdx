There are two methods to monitor the APM Server binary.
Make sure monitoring is enabled on your ((es)) cluster,
then configure one of these methods to collect APM Server metrics:

* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-monitoring-internal-collection">Internal collection</DocLink> - Internal
    collectors send monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster.

export let serverless = false

<DocIf condition={ serverless === false }>
* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-monitoring-metricbeat-collection">((metricbeat)) collection</DocLink> -
    ((metricbeat)) collects monitoring data from your APM Server instance
    and sends it directly to your monitoring cluster.

* <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-monitoring-local-collection">Local collection</DocLink> - Local collection sends
    select monitoring data directly to the standard indices of your monitoring
    cluster.
