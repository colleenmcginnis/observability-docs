<div id="apm-monitoring-local-collection"></div>

In 8.11 and later, we emit a selected set of metrics directly to the monitoring
cluster.
The benefit of using local collection instead of internal collection is that
the metrics are sent directly to your main monitoring index, making it easier
to view shared data.
