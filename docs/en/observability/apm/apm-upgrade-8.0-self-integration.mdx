## Prerequisites

    must be upgraded to version 7.17. To upgrade ((es)) and ((kib)),
    see the [((stack)) Installation and Upgrade Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/7.17/upgrading-elastic-stack.html)

## Upgrade steps

1. Upgrade the ((stack)) to version ((version)).

    The ((stack)) (((es)) and ((kib))) must be upgraded before ((agent)).
    See the [((stack)) Installation and Upgrade Guide](((stack-ref))/upgrading-elastic-stack.html) for guidance.

1. Upgrade ((agent)) to version ((version)).
    As a part of this process, the APM integration will automatically upgrade to version ((version)).

    1. In ((fleet)), select **Agents**.

    1. Under **Agents**, click **Upgrade available** to see a list of agents that you can upgrade.

    1. Choose **Upgrade agent** from the **Actions** menu next to the agent you want to upgrade.
        The **Upgrade agent** option is grayed out when an upgrade is unavailable, or
        the ((kib)) version is lower than the agent version.

    For more details, or for bulk upgrade instructions, see
    [Upgrade ((agent))](((fleet-guide))/upgrade-elastic-agent.html)
