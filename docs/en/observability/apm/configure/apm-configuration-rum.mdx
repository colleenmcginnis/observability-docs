<ApmSupportOverview binary={true} fleet={true}>
  Most options in this section are supported by all APM Server deployment methods.
</ApmSupportOverview>

The [Real User Monitoring (RUM) agent](((apm-rum-ref-v))/index.html) captures user interactions with clients such as web browsers.
These interactions are sent as events to the APM Server.
Because the RUM agent runs on the client side, the connection between agent and server is unauthenticated.
As a security precaution, RUM is therefore disabled by default.

<RumConfigWidget />

In addition, if APM Server is deployed in an origin different than the pageâ€™s origin,
you will need to configure [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](((apm-rum-ref-v))/configuring-cors.html) in the Agent.

<div id="apm-enable-rum-support"></div>

## Configuration reference

<div id="apm-rum-enable"></div>

### Enable RUM
To enable RUM support, set to `true`.
By default this is disabled. (bool)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.rum.enabled` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Enable RUM` |

<DocCallOut title="Note">

If an <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-api-key">API key</DocLink> or <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-secret-token">secret token</DocLink> is configured,
enabling RUM support will automatically enable <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-configuration-anonymous">Configure anonymous authentication</DocLink>.
Anonymous authentication is required as the RUM agent runs in the browser.

</DocCallOut>

<div id="apm-rum-allow-origins"></div>

### Allowed Origins
A list of permitted origins for RUM support.
User-agents send an Origin header that will be validated against this list.
This is done automatically by modern browsers as part of the [CORS specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).
An origin is made of a protocol scheme, host and port, without the URL path.

Default: `['*']` (allows everything). (text)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.rum.allow_origins` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Allowed Origins` |

<div id="apm-rum-allow-headers"></div>

### Access-Control-Allow-Headers
HTTP requests made from the RUM agent to the APM Server are limited in the HTTP headers they are allowed to have.
If any other headers are added, the request will be rejected by the browser due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions.
Use this setting to allow additional headers.
The default list of allowed headers includes "Content-Type", "Content-Encoding", and "Accept";
custom values configured here are appended to the default list and used as the value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header.

Default: `[]`. (text)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.rum.allow_headers` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` |

<div id="apm-rum-response-headers"></div>

### Custom HTTP response headers
Custom HTTP headers to add to RUM responses.
This can be useful for security policy compliance.

Values set for the same key will be concatenated.

Default: none. (text)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.rum.response_headers` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Custom HTTP response headers` |

<div id="apm-rum-library-pattern"></div>

### Library Frame Pattern
RegExp to be matched against a stack trace frame's `file_name` and `abs_path` attributes.
If the RegExp matches, the stack trace frame is considered to be a library frame.
When source mapping is applied, the `error.culprit` is set to reflect the _function_ and the _filename_
of the first non library frame.
This aims to provide an entry point for identifying issues.

Default: `"node_modules|bower_components|~"`. (text)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.rum.library_pattern` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Library Frame Pattern` |

<div id="exclude_from_grouping"></div>

### Exclude from grouping
RegExp to be matched against a stack trace frame's `file_name`.
If the RegExp matches, the stack trace frame is excluded from being used for calculating error groups.

Default: `"^/webpack"` (excludes stack trace frames that have a filename starting with `/webpack`). (text)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.rum.exclude_from_grouping` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Exclude from grouping` |

<div id="apm-rum-source-map"></div>

## Source map configuration options

<ApmSupportOverview binary={true} fleet={false}>
  Source maps are supported by all APM Server deployment methods, however,
  the options in this section are only supported by the APM Server binary.
</ApmSupportOverview>

<div id="apm-config-sourcemapping-enabled"></div>

### `source_mapping.enabled`
Used to enable/disable <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-source-map-how-to">source mapping</DocLink> for RUM events.
When enabled, the APM Server needs additional privileges to read source maps.
See <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-privileges-rum-source-map" section="apm-server-rum-source-mapping">APM Server RUM source mapping</DocLink> for more details.

Default: `true`

<div id="apm-config-sourcemapping-elasticsearch"></div>

### `source_mapping.elasticsearch`
Configure the ((es)) source map retrieval location, taking the same options as <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-elasticsearch-output">output.elasticsearch</DocLink>.
This must be set when using an output other than ((es)), and that output is writing to ((es)).
Otherwise leave this section empty.

<div id="apm-rum-sourcemap-cache"></div>

### `source_mapping.cache.expiration`
If a source map has been uploaded to the APM Server,
<DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-source-map-how-to">source mapping</DocLink> is automatically applied to documents sent to the RUM endpoint.
Source maps are fetched from ((es)) and then kept in an in-memory cache for the configured time.
Values configured without a time unit are treated as seconds.

Default: `5m` (5 minutes)

<div id="`source_mapping.index_pattern`"></div>

### `source_mapping.index_pattern`
Previous versions of APM Server stored source maps in `apm-%{[observer.version]}-sourcemap` indices.
Search source maps stored in an older version with this setting.

Default: `"apm-*-sourcemap*"`

<div id="apm-rum-deprecated"></div>

## Deprecated configuration options

<div id="apm-event_rate.limit"></div>

### `event_rate.limit`

<DocCallOut title="Deprecated in 7.15.0" color="danger">
Replaced by <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-configuration-anonymous" section="event-limit">Event limit</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>

The maximum number of events allowed per second, per agent IP address.

Default: `300`

<div id="`event_rate.lru_size`"></div>

### `event_rate.lru_size`

<DocCallOut title="Deprecated in 7.15.0" color="danger">
Replaced by <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-configuration-anonymous" section="ip-limit">IP limit</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>

The number of unique IP addresses to track in an LRU cache.
IP addresses in the cache will be rate limited according to the <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-configuration-anonymous" section="event-limit">Event limit</DocLink> setting.
Consider increasing this default if your site has many concurrent clients.

Default: `1000`

<div id="apm-rum-allow-service-names"></div>

### `allow_service_names`

<DocCallOut title="Deprecated in 7.15.0" color="danger">
Replaced by <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-configuration-anonymous" section="allowed-services">Allowed services</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>
A list of permitted service names for RUM support.
Names in this list must match the agent's `service.name`.
This can be set to restrict RUM events to those with one of a set of known service names,
in order to limit the number of service-specific indices or data streams created.

Default: Not set (any service name is accepted)

<div id="ingest_pipelines"></div>

## Ingest pipelines

The default APM Server pipeline includes processors that enrich RUM data prior to indexing in ((es)).
See <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-ingest-pipelines">Parse data using ingest pipelines</DocLink> for details on how to locate, edit, or disable this preprocessing.
