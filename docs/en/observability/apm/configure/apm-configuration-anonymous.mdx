Elastic APM agents can send unauthenticated (anonymous) events to the APM Server.
An event is considered to be anonymous if no authentication token can be extracted from the incoming request.
This is useful for agents that run on clients, like the Real User Monitoring (RUM)
agent running in a browser, or the Android or iOS/Swift agent running in a user application.

Enable anonymous authentication in the APM Server to allow the
ingestion of unauthenticated client-side APM data while still requiring authentication for server-side services.

## Real User Monitoring (RUM)

If an <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmApiKey">API key</DocLink> or <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmSecretToken">secret token</DocLink> is configured,
then anonymous authentication must be enabled to collect RUM data.
For this reason, anonymous auth will be enabled automatically if <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationRum" section="enable-rum">Enable RUM</DocLink>
is set to `true`, and <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationAnonymous" section="anonymous-agent-access">Anonymous Agent access</DocLink> is not explicitly defined.

See <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationRum">Configure Real User Monitoring (RUM)</DocLink> for additional RUM configuration options.

### Mitigating malicious requests

There are a few configuration variables that can mitigate the impact of malicious requests to an
unauthenticated APM Server endpoint.

Use the <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationAnonymous" section="allowed-anonymous-agents">Allowed anonymous agents</DocLink> and <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationAnonymous" section="allowed-services">Allowed services</DocLink> configs to ensure that the
`agent.name` and `service.name` of each incoming request match a specified list.

Additionally, the APM Server can rate-limit unauthenticated requests based on the client IP address
(`client.ip`) of the request with <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationAnonymous" section="event-limit">Event limit</DocLink>.
This allows you to specify the maximum number of requests allowed per unique IP address, per second.

<div id="apm-config-auth-anon-client-ip"></div>

### Deriving an incoming request's `client.ip` address

The remote IP address of an incoming request might be different
from the end-user's actual IP address, for example, because of a proxy. For this reason,
the APM Server attempts to derive the IP address of an incoming request from HTTP headers.
The supported headers are parsed in the following order:

1. `Forwarded`
1. `X-Real-Ip`
1. `X-Forwarded-For`

If none of these headers are present, the remote address for the incoming request is used.

<div id="apm-config-auth-anon-client-ip-concerns"></div>

### Using a reverse proxy or load balancer

HTTP headers are easily modified;
it's possible for anyone to spoof the derived `client.ip` value by changing or setting,
for example, the value of the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
For this reason, if any of your clients are not trusted,
we recommend setting up a reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the APM Server.

Using a proxy allows you to clear any existing IP-forwarding HTTP headers,
and replace them with one set by the proxy.
This prevents malicious users from cycling spoofed IP addresses to bypass the
APM Server's rate limiting feature.

## Configuration reference

<div id="apm-config-auth-anon-enabled"></div>

### Anonymous Agent access

Enable or disable anonymous authentication.
Default: `false` (disabled). (bool)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.auth.anonymous.enabled` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Anonymous Agent access` |

<div id="apm-config-auth-anon-allow-agent"></div>

### Allowed anonymous agents
A list of permitted ((apm-agent)) names for anonymous authentication.
Names in this list must match the agent's `agent.name`.
Default: `[rum-js, js-base]` (only RUM agent events are accepted). (array)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.auth.anonymous.allow_agent` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Allowed Anonymous agents` |

<div id="apm-config-auth-anon-allow-service"></div>

### Allowed services
A list of permitted service names for anonymous authentication.
Names in this list must match the agent's `service.name`.
This can be used to limit the number of service-specific indices or data streams created.
Default: Not set (any service name is accepted). (array)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.auth.anonymous.allow_service` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Allowed Anonymous services` |

<div id="apm-config-auth-anon-ip-limit"></div>

### IP limit
The number of unique IP addresses to track in an LRU cache.
IP addresses in the cache will be rate limited according to the <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationAnonymous" section="event-limit">Event limit</DocLink> setting.
Consider increasing this default if your application has many concurrent clients.
Default: `1000`. (int)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.auth.anonymous.rate_limit.ip_limit` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Anonymous Rate limit (IP limit)` |

<div id="apm-config-auth-anon-event-limit"></div>

### Event limit
The maximum number of events allowed per second, per agent IP address.
Default: `300`. (int)

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.auth.anonymous.rate_limit.event_limit` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Anonymous Event rate limit (event limit)` |
