## Source maps

Source maps can be uploaded through all outputs but must eventually be stored in ((es)).
When using outputs other than ((es)), `source_mapping.elasticsearch` must be set for source maps to be applied.
Be sure to update `source_mapping.index_pattern` if source maps are stored in the non-default location.
See <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmConfigurationRum" section="source_mappingelasticsearch">`source_mapping.elasticsearch`</DocLink> for more details.
