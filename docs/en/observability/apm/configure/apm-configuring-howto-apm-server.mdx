How you configure the APM Server depends on your deployment method.

* **APM Server binary** users need to edit the `apm-server.yml` configuration file.
    The location of the file varies by platform. To locate the file, see <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-directory-layout">Installation layout</DocLink>.

* **Fleet-managed** users configure the APM Server directly in ((kib)).
    Each configuration page describes the specific location.

* **Elastic cloud** users should see [Add APM user settings](((cloud))/ec-manage-apm-settings.html) for information on how to configure Elastic APM.
