<div id="sampling-tail-interval-{input_type}"></div>

## Interval
Synchronization interval for multiple APM Servers.
Should be in the order of tens of seconds or low minutes.
Default: `1m` (1 minute). (duration)

<div id="sampling-tail-policies-{input_type}"></div>

## Policies
Criteria used to match a root transaction to a sample rate.

Policies map trace events to a sample rate.
Each policy must specify a sample rate.
Trace events are matched to policies in the order specified.
All policy conditions must be true for a trace event to match.
Each policy list should conclude with a policy that only specifies a sample rate.
This final policy is used to catch remaining trace events that don't match a stricter policy.

<div id="sampling-tail-storage_limit-{input_type}"></div>

## Storage limit
The amount of storage space allocated for trace events matching tail sampling policies. Caution: Setting this limit higher than the allowed space may cause APM Server to become unhealthy.

If the configured storage limit is insufficient, it logs "configured storage limit reached". The event will bypass sampling and will always be indexed when storage limit is reached.

Default: `3GB`. (text)
