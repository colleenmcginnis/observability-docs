By default, APM Server sends all its output to syslog. When you run APM Server in
the foreground, you can use the `-e` command line flag to redirect the output to
standard error instead. For example:

```sh
apm-server -e
```

The default configuration file is apm-server.yml (the location of the file varies by
platform). You can use a different configuration file by specifying the `-c` flag. For example:

```sh
apm-server -e -c myapm-serverconfig.yml
```

You can increase the verbosity of debug messages by enabling one or more debug
selectors. For example, to view publisher-related messages, start APM Server
with the `publisher` selector:

```sh
apm-server -e -d "publisher"
```

If you want all the debugging output (fair warning, it's quite a lot), you can
use `*`, like this:

```sh
apm-server -e -d "*"
```
