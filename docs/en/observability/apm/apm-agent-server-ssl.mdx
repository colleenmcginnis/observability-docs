<ApmSupportOverview binary={true} fleet={true}>
  Most options on this page are supported by all APM Server deployment methods.
</ApmSupportOverview>

These settings apply to SSL/TLS communication between the APM Server and APM Agents.
See <DocLink slug="/en/observability/apm-agent-tls">((apm-agent)) TLS communication</DocLink> to learn more.

<TlsWidget />

<div id="enable_tls"></div>

## Enable TLS

Enable or disable TLS. Disabled by default.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.enabled` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Enable TLS` |

<div id="file_path_to_server_certificate"></div>

## File path to server certificate

The path to the file containing the certificate for Server authentication.
Required if TLS is enabled.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.certificate` |
| Fleet-managed     | `File path to server certificate` |

<div id="file_path_to_server_certificate_key"></div>

## File path to server certificate key

The path to the file containing the Server certificate key.
Required if TLS is enabled.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.key` |
| Fleet-managed     | `File path to server certificate key` |

<div id="key_passphrase"></div>

## Key passphrase

The passphrase used to decrypt an encrypted key stored in the configured `apm-server.ssl.key` file.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.key_passphrase` |
| Fleet-managed     | N/A |

<div id="supported_protocol_versions"></div>

## Supported protocol versions

This setting is a list of allowed protocol versions:
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`. We do not recommend using `SSLv3` or `TLSv1.0`.
The default value is `[TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3]`.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.supported_protocols` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Supported protocol versions` |

<div id="cipher_suites_for_tls_connections"></div>

## Cipher suites for TLS connections

The list of cipher suites to use. The first entry has the highest priority.
If this option is omitted, the Go crypto library's [default suites](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/)
are used (recommended). Note that TLS 1.3 cipher suites are not
individually configurable in Go, so they are not included in this list.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.cipher_suites` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Cipher suites for TLS connections` |

<SharedSslConfig />

<div id="curve_types_for_ecdhe_based_cipher_suites"></div>

## Curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites

The list of curve types for ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange).

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.curve_types` |
| Fleet-managed     | `Curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites` |

<div id="list_of_root_certificates_for_verifying_client_certificates"></div>

## List of root certificates for verifying client certificates

The list of root certificates for verifying client certificates.
If `certificate_authorities` is empty or not set, the trusted certificate authorities of the host system are used.
If `certificate_authorities` is set, `client_authentication` will be automatically set to `required`.
Sending client certificates is currently only supported by the RUM agent through the browser,
the Java agent (see [Agent certificate authentication](((apm-java-ref-v))/ssl-configuration.html)),
and the Jaeger agent.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.certificate_authorities` |
| Fleet-managed     | N/A |

<div id="client_authentication"></div>

## Client authentication

This configures what types of client authentication are supported. The valid options
are `none`, `optional`, and `required`. The default is `none`.
If `certificate_authorities` has been specified, this setting will automatically change to `required`.
This option only needs to be configured when the agent is expected to provide a client certificate.
Sending client certificates is currently only supported by the RUM agent through the browser,
the Java agent (see [Agent certificate authentication](((apm-java-ref-v))/ssl-configuration.html)),
and the Jaeger agent.

* `none` - Disables client authentication.
* `optional` - When a client certificate is given, the server will verify it.
* `required` - Requires clients to provide a valid certificate.

|---|---|
| APM Server binary | `apm-server.ssl.client_authentication` |
| Fleet-managed     | N/A |
