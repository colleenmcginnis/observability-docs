### Breaking Changes
- The unsupported apm_data_stream_migration ingest pipeline has been removed [12102]({pull}12102).
- "publish_ready" is always false in the "GET /" response until events are received by apm-server [12150]({pull}12150)
- Reverts a breaking change that ignored the beat name. This is visible in Stack Monitoring [12176]({pull}12176)
- A bug has been introduced, so that `traces-apm@custom` ingest pipeline is now additionally applied to data streams `traces-apm.sampled-*` and `traces-apm.rum-*` and applied twice for `traces-apm-*`. See more details and information around a fix in the Known Issues section.
