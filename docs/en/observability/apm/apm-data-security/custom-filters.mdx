|  |  |
|---|---|
| <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmCustomFilter" section="create-an-ingest-pipeline-filter">Ingest pipelines</DocLink> | Applied at ingestion time. All agents and fields are supported. Data leaves the instrumented service. There are no performance overhead implications on the instrumented service. |
| <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmCustomFilter" section="apm-agent-filters">((apm-agent)) filters</DocLink> | Not supported by all agents. Data is sanitized before leaving the instrumented service. Potential overhead implications on the instrumented service |
