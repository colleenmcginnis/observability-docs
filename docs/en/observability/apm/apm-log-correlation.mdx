<div id="apm-log-correlation"></div>

Elastic APM integrates with popular logging frameworks, making it easy to correlate your logs and traces.
This enables you to:

- view the context of a log and the parameters provided by a user
- view all logs belonging to a particular trace
- easily move between logs and traces when debugging application issues

See the <DocLink slug="/en/observability/application-logs">Stream application logs</DocLink> guide to get started.
