Elastic APM lets you monitor your AWS Lambda functions.
The natural integration of <DocLink id="enObservabilityApmDistributedTracing">distributed tracing</DocLink> into your AWS Lambda functions provides insights into the function's execution and runtime behavior as well as its relationships and dependencies to other services.

To get started with the setup of Elastic APM for your Lambda functions, checkout the language-specific guides:

* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Node.js](((apm-node-ref))/lambda.html)
* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Python](((apm-py-ref))/lambda-support.html)
* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Java](((apm-java-ref))/aws-lambda.html)

Or, see the [architecture guide](((apm-lambda-ref))/aws-lambda-arch.html) to learn more about how the extension works,
performance impacts, and more.
