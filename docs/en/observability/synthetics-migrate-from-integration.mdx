The Elastic Synthetics integration is a method for creating
synthetic monitors that is no longer recommended.

You should _not_ use the Elastic Synthetics integration to set up new monitors and
should make a plan to migrate existing monitors to use either **((project-monitors-cap))** or the **((synthetics-app))**:

* With Elastic **((project-monitors-cap))**, you write tests in an external version-controlled project
    and use a CLI tool to push monitors to the ((stack)).

* The **((synthetics-app))** is an application in ((kib)) that you can use to configure and create
    monitors using a user interface.

## Compare approaches

Below is a comparison of how you used the ((agent)) integration to create
monitors and how you'll use the ((synthetics-app)) or projects to create monitors:

## Where monitors run

If you want to continue hosting on your infrastructure, you will need to create a
((private-location)) before creating monitors.
If you have already have an ((agent)) running using `elastic-agent-complete`,
you can <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-private-location" section="add-a-((private-location))">add it as a new ((private-location))</DocLink>
in the ((synthetics-app)).
To create a new ((private-location)) from scratch, follow all instructions in
<DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-private-location">Monitor resources on private networks</DocLink>.

Alternatively, you can start hosting on Elastic's global managed infrastructure.
With Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure, you can create and run monitors in multiple
locations without having to manage your own infrastructure.
Elastic takes care of software updates and capacity planning for you.

## How to use projects

If you already have an external project you were adding via a ZIP URL
you can use the same project, but you will have to make some changes.

First, upgrade the existing project to use the latest version of
`@elastic/synthetics`:

1. Run `npm install -g @elastic/synthetics@latest` to install
    the latest version of the CLI.

1. Upgrade your existing project to use new project settings:
    1. Run `npm @elastic/synthetics init <path-to-existing-project>`.
    1. Respond to all prompts provided by the CLI.

        <DocCallOut title="Note">

        To ensure that your project will work with the latest version of Elastic Synthetics,
        the CLI will create a new configuration file on `init`, but you will see a prompt
        asking if you would like to continue before overwriting an existing configuration file.

        </DocCallOut>

1. Review updated files and directories, including:
    1. `journeys/` will contain sample journey code.
        Move existing journey files into this directory.

    1. `synthetics.config.ts` will contain updated default settings
        needed for the upgraded project.

    1. `package.json` will contain updated NPM settings for your project.

        <DocCallOut title="Note">

        If there is already a `package.json` file in the directory when you run `init`,
        the synthetics agent will _not_ create a new `package.json` file.
        Instead it will modify the existing `package.json` file to:

        * Add `@elastic/synthetics` library to the dependencies if it's not already present.
        * Add a `test` and `push` script if they are not already present.

        </DocCallOut>

    1. `.github/` will contain sample workflow files to use with GitHub Actions.

Then, you can further configure monitors as needed.
In the upgraded project, you'll use code (instead of the Integrations UI)
to define settings like the name of the monitor and the frequency at which it will run.
There are two ways you can configure monitors using code:

* For individual monitors, use `monitor.use` directly in the journey code.
    Read more in <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-monitor-use">Configure individual browser monitors</DocLink>.

* To configure all monitors at once, use the synthetics configuration file.
    Read more in <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-configuration">Configure Synthetics projects</DocLink>.

Finally, you'll create monitors using `push` instead of by adding a ZIP URL in
the Integrations UI. This will require an API token.
Read more in <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-command-reference" section="elasticsynthetics-push">`@elastic/synthetics push`</DocLink>.

Optionally, you can also add lightweight monitors to the project in YAML files.
Read more about adding lightweight monitors to projects in <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-lightweight">Configure lightweight monitors</DocLink>.

refer to <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-get-started-project">Create monitors with ((project-monitors-cap))</DocLink>.

<div id="synthetics-migrate-integration-ui"></div>

## How to use the UI

If you created monitors solely via the Elastic Synthetics integration UI,
you can recreate monitors in the ((synthetics-app)).

The configuration options in the ((synthetics-app)) look very similar to the
Elastic Synthetics integration UI with a few exceptions.
In the ((synthetics-app)):

1. You will select one or more locations for each monitor.
1. You cannot use a ZIP URL for browser monitors.
    Use projects instead.

1. You can test the configuration (including the journey for browser monitors)
    using **Run test** before creating the monitor.

For more information on getting started with the ((synthetics-app)),
refer to <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-get-started-ui">Create monitors in the ((synthetics-app))</DocLink>.
