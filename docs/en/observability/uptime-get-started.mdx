**This approach can only be used to create lightweight monitors.** To create _browser_ monitors, use the <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsGetStarted">((synthetics-app))</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>

((heartbeat)) is a lightweight daemon that you install on a remote server to periodically
check the status of your services and determine if they are available. It gathers performance data,
formats it, and sends the data to the ((stack)).

![Diagram showing which pieces of software are used to configure monitors, create monitors, and view results when using ((heartbeat)). Described in detail in Diagram text description.](images/synthetics-get-started-heartbeat.png)

<DocCallOut title="Note">

The Elastic Synthetics integration is a method for creating
synthetic monitors that is no longer recommended.
**Do not use the Elastic Synthetics integration to set up new monitors.**

For details on how to migrate from Elastic Synthetics integration to
((project-monitors)) or the ((synthetics-app)), refer to <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsMigrateFromIntegration">Migrate from the Elastic Synthetics integration</DocLink>.

If you've used the Elastic Synthetics integration to create monitors in the past
and need to reference documentation about the integration, go to the
[8.3 documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/8.3/uptime-set-up.html#uptime-set-up-choose-agent).

## Pull the Docker image

Elastic provides Docker images that you can use to run monitors.
Start by pulling the ((heartbeat)) Docker image.

<DocIf condition={ "((release-state))" === "unreleased" }>

Version ((version)) has not yet been released.

</DocIf>

<DocIf condition={ "((release-state))" !== "unreleased" }>

```sh
docker pull docker.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat:((version))
```

</DocIf>

<div id="uptime-set-up-config"></div>

## Configure

Next, create a `heartbeat.yml` configuration file.

The example below shows how to configure an `http` monitor, one of [three types of lightweight monitors](((heartbeat-ref))/configuration-heartbeat-options.html#monitor-types).

```yml
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  id: service-status  [^1]
  name: Service Status
  service.name: my-apm-service-name
  hosts: ["http://localhost:80/service/status"]
  check.response.status: [200]
  schedule: '@every 5s'
```
[^1]: Each `monitor` gets its own ID in the ((uptime-app)) and its own schedule entry.
This allows tests to be run in parallel and analyzed separately.

Read more about configuration options in [Configure ((heartbeat)) monitors](((heartbeat-ref))/configuration-heartbeat-options.html).

<DocCallOut title="Warning" color="warning">

**Do not use ((heartbeat)) to set up a _new_ `browser` monitor.** Instead, use the <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsGetStarted">((synthetics-app))</DocLink>.

If you previously used ((heartbeat)) to set up **`browser`** monitor, you can find resources in the
[8.4 ((heartbeat)) documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/8.4/monitor-browser-options.html).

</DocCallOut>

<div id="uptime-set-up-connect"></div>

## Connect to the ((stack))

After configuring the monitor, run it in Docker and connect the monitor to the ((stack)).

<DocIf condition={ "((release-state))" === "unreleased" }>

Version ((version)) has not yet been released.

</DocIf>

<DocIf condition={ "((release-state))" !== "unreleased" }>

You'll need to retrieve your ((es)) credentials for either an [((ecloud)) ID](((heartbeat-ref))/configure-cloud-id.html) or another [((es)) Cluster](((heartbeat-ref))/elasticsearch-output.html).

The example below, shows how to run synthetics tests indexing data into ((es)).
You'll need to insert your actual `cloud.id` and `cloud.auth` values to successfully index data to your cluster.

{/* NOTE: We do NOT us \<1> references in the below example, because they create whitespace after the trailing \ */}
{/* when copied into a shell, which creates mysterious errors when copy and pasting! */}

```sh
docker run \
  --rm \
  --name=heartbeat \
  --user=heartbeat \
  --volume="$PWD/heartbeat.yml:/usr/share/heartbeat/heartbeat.yml:ro" \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  docker.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat:((version)) heartbeat -e \
  -E cloud.id={cloud_id} \
  -E cloud.auth=elastic:{cloud_pass}
```

If you aren't using ((ecloud)), replace `-E cloud.id` and `-E cloud.auth` with your ((es)) hosts,
username, and password:

```sh
docker run \
  --rm \
  --name=heartbeat \
  --user=heartbeat \
  --volume="$PWD/heartbeat.yml:/usr/share/heartbeat/heartbeat.yml:ro" \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  docker.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat:((version)) heartbeat -e \
  -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=["localhost:9200"] \
  -E output.elasticsearch.username=elastic \
  -E output.elasticsearch.password=changeme
```

Note the `--volume` option, which mounts local directories into the
container. Here, we mount the `heartbeat.yml` from the working directory,
into ((heartbeat))'s expected location for `heartbeat.yml`.

<DocCallOut title="Warning" color="warning">
Elastic Synthetics runs Chromium without the extra protection of its process
[sandbox](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/sandboxing.md)
for greater compatibility with Linux server distributions.
Add the `sandbox: true` option to a given browser monitor in ((heartbeat)) to enable sandboxing.
This may require using a custom seccomp policy with docker, which brings its own added risks.
This is generally safe when run against sites whose content you trust,
and with a recent version of Elastic Synthetics and Chromium.

## View in ((kib))

((heartbeat)) is now sending synthetic monitoring data to the ((stack)).
Navigate to the ((uptime-app)) in ((kib)), where you can see screenshots of each run,
set up alerts in case of test failures, and more.

If a test does fail (shown as `down` in the ((uptime-app))), you'll be able to view the step script that failed,
any errors, and a stack trace.
For more information, refer to <DocLink id="enObservabilityUptimeAnalyze">Analyze</DocLink>.

<div id="uptime-manage"></div>

## Manage monitors

After you've created a monitor, you'll need to manage that monitor over time.
This might include updating or permanently deleting an existing monitor.

To update a monitor's configuration, update the relevant options in the ((heartbeat))
configuration file, and the changes will be reflected in the monitors.

To permanently delete a monitor, delete the monitor entry in the `heartbeat.yml` file.
