<div id="tail-logs"></div>

Within the ((logs-app)), the **Stream** page enables you to monitor all of the log events flowing in from your
servers, virtual machines, and containers in a centralized view. You can consider this as a `tail -f` in your browser,
along with the power of search.

Click **Stream Live** to view a continuous flow of log messages in real time, or
click **Stop streaming** to view historical logs from a specified time range.

<div id="filter-logs"></div>

## Filter logs

To help you get started with your analysis faster and extract fields from your logs, use the search bar
to create structured queries using [((kib)) Query Language](((kibana-ref))/kuery-query.html).
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"` to see only the information for `host1`.

Additionally, click **Highlights** and enter a term you would like to locate within the log events. The Logs
histogram, located to the right, highlights the number of discovered terms and when the log event was ingested.
This helps you quickly jump between potential areas of interest in large amounts of logs, or from a high level,
view when a large number of events occurred.

## Inspect log event details

When you have searched and filtered your logs for a specific log event, you may want to examine the
metadata and the structured fields associated with that event. To view the **Log event document details** fly-out,
hover over the log event, click **View actions for line**, and then select **View details**. To further enhance
the workflow of monitoring logs, the icons next to each field value enable you to filter the logs per that value.

<div id="view-contextual-logs"></div>

## View contextual logs

Once your logs are filtered, and you find an interesting log line, the real context you are looking for is
what happened before and after that log line within that data source. For example, you are running
containerized applications on a Kubernetes cluster, you filter the logs for the term `error`, and you find an
interesting error log line. The context you want is what happened before and after the error line within the
logs of this container and application.

Hover over the log event, click **View actions for line**, and then select **View in context**. The context is
preserved and helps you find the root cause as soon as possible.

## Integrate with Uptime and APM

To see other actions related to a log event, click **Actions** in the **Log event document details** fly-out.
Depending on the event and the features you have configured, you can:

* Select **View status in Uptime** to <DocLink id="enObservabilityViewMonitorStatus">view related uptime information</DocLink> in the ((uptime-app)).
* Select **View in APM** to [view corresponding APM traces](((kibana-ref))/traces.html) in the ((apm-app)).
