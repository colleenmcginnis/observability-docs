**New to Elastic?** Follow the steps in our [getting started guide](((estc-welcome))/getting-started-observability.html) instead
of the steps described here.

</DocCallOut>

This guide describes how to:

* Monitor logs and infrastructure metrics from systems and services across your organization
* Monitor Nginx logs and metrics using the Nginx integration

For feedback and questions, please contact us in the [discuss forum](((forum))).

<div id="logs-metrics-prereqs"></div>

## Prerequisites

<MonitoringPrereqs />

<div id="add-system-integration"></div>

## Step 1: Add the ((agent)) System integration

((agent)) is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query
data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and
more. A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your
infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy you can update to add
integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.

In this step, add the System integration to monitor host logs and metrics.

1. Go to the ((kib)) home page and click **Add integrations**.

    ![((kib)) home page](images/kibana-home.png)

1. In the query bar, search for **System** and select the integration to see more
    details about it.

1. Click **Add System**.

1. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
    Make sure that **Collect logs from System instances** and
    **Collect metrics from System instances** are turned on.

1. Expand each configuration section to verify that the settings are correct for
    your host. For example, if you're  deploying ((agent)) on macOS hosts, you
    need to add a new path to the _System syslog logs_ section by clicking
    **Add row** and specifying `/var/log/system.log`.

    ![Configuration page for adding log paths to the ((agent)) System integration](images/kibana-agent-add-log-path.png)

1. Click **Save and continue**. This step takes a minute or two to complete. When
    it's done, you'll have an agent policy that contains a system integration policy
    for the configuration you just specified.

    ![Configuration page for adding the ((agent)) System integration](images/kibana-system-policy.png)

1. In the popup, click **Add ((agent)) to your hosts** to open the **Add agent**
    flyout.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    If you accidentally close the popup, go to **((fleet)) > Agents**, then click
    **Add agent** to access the flyout.
    </DocCallOut>

<div id="add-agent-to-fleet"></div>

## Step 2: Install and run an ((agent)) on your machine

The **Add agent** flyout has two options: **Enroll in ((fleet))** and
**Run standalone**. The default is to enroll the agents in ((fleet)), as this
reduces the amount of work on the person managing the hosts by providing
a centralized management tool in ((kib)).

1. Skip the **Select enrollment token** step. The enrollment token you need is
    already selected.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    The enrollment token is specific to the ((agent)) policy that you just
    created. When you run the command to enroll the agent in ((fleet)), you will pass
    in the enrollment token.
    </DocCallOut>

1. Download, install, and enroll the ((agent)) on your host by selecting
    your host operating system and following the **Install ((agent)) on your host**
    step.

    ![Add agent flyout in ((kib))](images/kibana-agent-flyout.png)

    It takes about a minute for ((agent)) to enroll in ((fleet)), download the
    configuration specified in the policy you just created, and start collecting
    data.

<div id="view-data"></div>

## Step 3: Monitor host logs and metrics

1. Verify that data is flowing. Wait until agent enrollment is confirmed and
    incoming data is received, then click **View assets** to access dashboards
    related to the System integration.

    ![Agent confirm data](images/kibana-agent-confirm-data.png)

1. Choose a dashboard that is related to the operating system of your
    monitored system. Dashboards are available for Microsoft Windows systems
    and Unix-like systems (for example, Linux and macOS).

    ![Agent list of visualizations](images/kibana-agent-system-integration-visualizations.png)

1. Open the **[Metrics System] Host overview** dashboard to view performance metrics
    from your host system.

    ![The Host Overview dashboard in ((kib)) with various metrics from your monitored system](images/host-metrics2.png)

You can hover over any visualization to adjust its settings, or click the
**Edit** button to make changes to the dashboard. To learn more, refer to
[Dashboard and visualizations](((kibana-ref))/dashboard.html).

<div id="add-nginx-integration"></div>

## Step 4: Monitor Nginx logs and metrics

Next, add an Nginx integration to the policy used by your agent.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
For these steps, we assume that you have `nginx` running on your host, and
want to collect logs and metrics from it. If not, you can skip this part of the
guide.
</DocCallOut>

1. In ((kib)), go to the **Integrations** page.

1. In the query bar, search for **Nginx** and select the integration to see more
    details about it.

1. Click **Add Nginx**.

1. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.

1. Expand each configuration section to verify that the settings are correct for
    your host. You may need to change the **Paths** settings.

1. Under **Where to add this integration**, select **Existing hosts**, then select
    the agent policy you created earlier. That way, you can deploy the change to
    the agent that's already running.

1. When you're done, click **Save and continue**, then **Save and deploy changes**.

1. To see the updated policy, click the agent policy link.

    The newly added Nginx integration should appear on the **Integrations** tab in
    your agent policy.

    ![((fleet)) showing default agent policy with nginx-1 data source](images/kibana-fleet-policies-default-with-nginx.png)

    Any ((agent))s assigned to this policy will collect logs and metrics from the
    Nginx server and the host, along with system logs and uptime data.

1. To view the data, go to **Management > ((fleet))**, then click the
    **Data streams** tab.

1. In the **Actions** column, navigate to the dashboards corresponding
    to the data stream.

## What's next?

* Monitor the status and response times of applications and services in real time using the ((uptime-app)).
    You can monitor the availability of network endpoints via HTTP, TCP, ICMP or Browser monitors. Get started in <DocLink slug="/en/observability/monitor-uptime-synthetics">Synthetic monitoring</DocLink>.

* Now that data is streaming into the ((stack)), take your investigation to a
    deeper level! Use [Elastic ((observability))](https://www.elastic.co/observability)
    to unify your logs, infrastructure metrics, uptime, and application performance data.

* Want to protect your endpoints from security threats? Try
    [((elastic-sec))](https://www.elastic.co/security). Adding endpoint protection is
    just another integration that you add to the agent policy!

* Are your eyes bleary from staring at a wall of screens?
    [Create alerts](((observability-guide))/create-alerts.html) and find out about
    problems while sipping your favorite beverage poolside.

* Want Elastic to do the heavy lifting? Use ((ml)) to
    [detect anomalies](((observability-guide))/inspect-log-anomalies.html).

* Got everything working like you want it? Roll out your agent policies to
    other hosts by deploying ((agent))s across your infrastructure!
