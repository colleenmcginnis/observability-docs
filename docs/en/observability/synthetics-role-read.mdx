<div id="synthetics-role-read"></div>

For users who need to view and create visualizations that access Synthetics data,
provide read access. Two types of read access are outlined below:

* **General read access**: For most users, you can use <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsRoleRead" section="general-read-access">General read access</DocLink>,
    which grants read access to all ((kib)) apps and requires little configuration.

* **Limited read access**: If you want to limit read access to the ((synthetics-app)) only,
    you can use <DocLink id="enObservabilitySyntheticsRoleRead" section="limited-read-access">Limited read access</DocLink>, which requires additional configuration.

<div id="synthetics-read-privileges-general"></div>

## General read access

For users who only need to view results in ((kib)),
use the `viewer` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html).

<div id="synthetics-read-privileges-limited"></div>

## Limited read access

If you want to limit read access to the ((synthetics-app)) only, do _not_ use the
`viewer` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html).

Instead to you can create a reader role, called something like `synthetics_reader_limited`,
and grant the following privileges:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `synthetics-*`: `read` | Read-only access to synthetics indices. |
| [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `.alerts-observability.uptime.alerts-*`: `read` | Read-only access to synthetics alert indices. |
| [Kibana](((kibana-ref))/kibana-privileges.html) | `Synthetics and Uptime`: `All` | Access to the ((synthetics-app)) in ((kib)). |
