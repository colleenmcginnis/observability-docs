Administrators who set up Synthetics typically need to enable Monitor Management.

Monitor Management will be enabled automatically when a user with the required permissions
loads the Synthetics UI. This must be completed just once by an admin before any users with
the <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-role-write">Writer role</DocLink> can create synthetic monitors. This applies to monitors created
via both <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-get-started-project">projects</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-get-started-ui">the UI</DocLink>.

As a best practice, **grant the setup role to administrators only**, and use a more restrictive
role for event publishing.

Create a **setup role**, called something like `synthetics_setup`:

1. Start with the `editor` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html).
    This role grants full access to all features in ((kib)) (including the ((observability)) solution)
    and read-only access to data indices.

<DocCallOut title="Note">

The `editor` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html) will grant write access
to _all_ ((kib)) apps. If you want to limit write access to the ((synthetics-app)) only,
refer to <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-role-write" section="limited-write-access">Limited write access</DocLink>.

If you choose this approach, you will still need to grant the privileges in the next step.

1. Grant the role additional privileges that are required to enable Monitor Management:

    1. Grant all of the following privileges:

        | Type | Privilege | Purpose |
        |---|---|---|
        | [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `monitor` | Allows the user to retrieve cluster details. |
        | [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_ilm` | Allows the user access to all index lifecycle management operations related to managing policies. |
        | [Cluster](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) | `read_pipeline` | Gives the user read-only access to the ingest pipline. |
        | [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `synthetics-*`: `view_index_metadata` | Gives the user read-only access to index and data stream metadata. |
        | [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `synthetics-*`: `create_doc` | Allows the user to index documents. |
        | [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `synthetics-*`: `auto_configure` | Permits auto-creation of indices and data streams. |
        | [Index](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) | `synthetics-*`: `monitor` | Gives access to all actions that are required for monitoring (recovery, segments info, index stats, and status). |

<DocCallOut title="Note">
If users with the setup role also need to create, modify, and delete monitors,
add the privileges defined in the <DocLink slug="/en/observability/synthetics-role-write">writer role</DocLink>.
