This section lists Elastic Common Schema (ECS) fields the Logs and Infrastructure apps use to display data.

ECS is an open source specification that defines a standard set of fields to use when storing event data in
((es)), such as logs and metrics. 

Beat modules (for example, [((filebeat)) modules](((filebeat-ref))/filebeat-modules.html))
are ECS-compliant, so manual field mapping is not required, and all data is
populated automatically in the Logs and Infrastructure apps. If you cannot use ((beats)), map your data to
[ECS fields](((ecs-ref))) (see [how to map data to ECS](((ecs-ref))/ecs-converting.html)).
You can also try using the experimental [ECS Mapper](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-mapper) tool.
