**New to Elastic?** Follow the steps in our [getting started guide](((estc-welcome))/getting-started-observability.html) instead
of the steps described here. Return to this tutorial after you've learned the
basics.

**Using the native Azure integration from the marketplace?** Refer to
<DocLink id="enObservabilityMonitorAzureNative">Monitor Microsoft Azure with the Azure Native ISV Service</DocLink>.

</DocCallOut>

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to deploy ((agent)) and monitor your Azure
infrastructure with Elastic ((observability)).

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-what-you-learn"></div>

## What you'll learn

You'll learn how to:

* Create an Azure service principal with permissions to read monitoring data.
* Collect Azure billing metrics.
* Collect Azure activity logs.
* Visualize the logs and infrastructure metrics in ((kib)).

<div id="azure-collect-metrics"></div>

## Step 1: Create an Azure service principal

In this step, you create an Azure service principal and then grant them access
to use the Azure REST API.

The [Azure REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/)
allows you to get insights into your Azure resources using different operations.
To access the Azure REST API, you need to use the Azure Resource Manager
authentication model. Therefore, you must authenticate all requests with Azure
Active Directory (Azure AD). You can create the service principal using the
[Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) or
[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps?view=azps-2.7.0).
Then, you need to grant access permission, which is detailed
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).
This tutorial shows how to use the Azure portal.

<div id="create_an_azure_service_principal"></div>

### Create an Azure service principal

1. Go to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Search for and
    select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. In the navigation pane, select **App registrations** and then click
    **New registration**.

1. Type the name of your application (this tutorial uses
    `ingest-tutorial-monitor-azure`) and click **Register** (accept the default
    values for other settings).

    ![Screenshot of the application registration](images/agent-tut-azure-register-app.png)

    Copy the **Application (client) ID** and save it for later. This ID is
    required to configure ((agent)) to connect to your Azure account.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Certificates & secrets**, and then click
    **New client secret** to create a new security key.

    ![Screenshot of adding a new client secret](images/agent-tut-azure-click-client-secret.png)

1. Type a description of the secret and select an expiration. Click **Add** to
    create the client secret. Under **Value**, copy the secret value and save it
    (along with your client ID) for later.

    <DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

    This is your only chance to copy the secret value. You can't retrieve this
    value after you leave this page!

    </DocCallOut>

<div id="grant_access_permission_for_your_service_principal"></div>

### Grant access permission for your service principal

After creating the Azure service principal, you need to grant it the correct
permissions. You need the `Billing Reader` role to configure ((agent)) to collect
billing metrics.

1. In the Azure Portal, search for and select **Subscriptions**.
1. In the Subscriptions page, click the name of your subscription.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. Click **Add** and select **Add role assignment**.
1. On the **Roles** tab, select the **Billing Reader** role, then click **Next**.
1. On the **Members** tab, select the option to assign access to
    **User, group, or service principal**.

1. Click **Select members**, then search for and select the principal you created
    earlier.

1. For the description, enter the name of your service principal.
1. Click **Next** to review the role assignment:

    ![Screen capture of adding a role assignment](images/agent-tut-azure-add-role-assignment.png)

1. Click **Review + assign** to grant the service principal access to your
    subscription.

<div id="elastic-agent-add-azure-integration"></div>

## Step 2: Install the Azure Billing Metrics integration

In this step, you install the Azure Billing Metrics integration in ((kib)). This
integration contains an input for collecting metrics, such as Azure usage
details and forecast information, about your subscription.

To add the integration:

1. Go to the ((kib)) home page and click **Add integrations**.

    ![Screenshot of the ((kib)) home page](images/kibana-home.png)

1. In the query bar, search for **Azure Billing** and select the Azure Billing
    Metrics integration to see more details about it.

1. Click **Add Azure Billing Metrics**.

1. Under Integration settings, configure the integration name and optionally add
    a description.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    If you don't see options for configuring the integration, you're probably
    in a workflow designed for new deployments. Follow the steps, then return to
    this tutorial when you're ready to configure the integration.

      ![Screenshot of integration settings for Azure](images/agent-tut-azure-integration-settings.png)
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
</DocTable>

1. Make sure the **Collect Azure Billing metrics** selector is turned on.

1. Accept the defaults to create a new agent policy.

1. Click **Save and continue**. This step takes a minute or two to complete. When
    it's done, you'll have an agent policy that contains the Azure configuration you
    just specified.

A popup should appear that prompts you to **Add ((agent)) to your hosts**.

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-install"></div>

## Step 3: Install and run an ((agent)) on your machine

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
To get support for the latest API changes from Azure, we recommend
that you use the latest in-service version of ((agent)) compatible with your
((stack)). Otherwise your integrations may not function as expected.
</DocCallOut>

You can install ((agent)) on any host that can access the Azure account and forward
events to ((es)).

1. In the popup, click **Add ((agent)) to your hosts** to open the **Add agent**
    flyout.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    If you accidentally closed the popup, go to **((fleet)) -> Agents**, then
    click **Add agent** to access the installation instructions.
    </DocCallOut>

    The **Add agent** flyout has two options: **Enroll in ((fleet))** and **Run
    standalone**. The default is to enroll the agents in ((fleet)), as this reduces
    the amount of work on the person managing the hosts by providing a centralized
    management tool in ((kib)).

1. The enrollment token you need should already be selected.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    The enrollment token is specific to the ((agent)) policy that you just
    created. When you run the command to enroll the agent in ((fleet)), you will pass
    in the enrollment token.
    </DocCallOut>

1. To download, install, and enroll the ((agent)), select your host operating
    system and copy the installation command shown in the instructions.

1. Run the command on the host where you want to install ((agent)).

It takes a few minutes for ((agent)) to enroll in ((fleet)), download the
configuration specified in the policy, and start collecting data. You can wait
to confirm incoming data, or close the window.

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-visualize-metrics"></div>

## Step 4: Visualize Azure billing metrics

Now that the metrics are streaming to ((es)), you can visualize them in ((kib)). In
Kibana, open the main menu and click **Dashboard**. Search for Azure Billing and
select the dashboard called **[Azure Billing] Billing Overview**.

![Screenshot of Azure billing overview dashboard](images/agent-tut-azure-billing-dashboard.png)

Keep in mind ((agent)) collects data every 24 hours.

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-collect-azure-activity-logs"></div>

## Step 5: Collect Azure activity logs

Azure activity logs provide insight into the operations performed on resources
in your subscription, such as when and who modified resources, and when virtual
machines were started (or failed to start).

In this step, you configure Azure to export activity logs to an Azure event hub,
then you configure the Azure Logs integration to read logs from the event hub
and send them to ((es)).

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-create-event-hub"></div>

### Create an event hub for your logs

[Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)
is a data streaming platform and event ingestion service that you use to store
in-flight Azure logs before sending them to ((es)). For this tutorial, you create
a single event hub because you are collecting logs from one service: the Azure
Monitor service.

To create an Azure event hub:

1. Go to the Azure portal.
1. Search for and select **Event Hubs**.
1. Click **Create** and create a new Event Hubs namespace. You'll need to create
    a new resource group, or choose an existing one.

1. Enter the required settings for the namespace and click **Review + create**.

    ![Screenshot of window for creating an event hub namespace](images/agent-tut-azure-create-eventhub.png)

1. Click **Create** to deploy the resource.
1. In the new namespace, click **+ Event Hub** and enter a name for the event
    hub.

1. Click **Review + create**, and then click **Create** to deploy the resource.
1. Make a note of the namespace and event hub name because you will need them
    later.

<DocCallOut>

**When do I need more than one event hub?**

Typically you create an event hub for each service you want to monitor. For
example, imagine that you want to collect activity logs from the Azure
Monitor service plus signin and audit logs from the Active Directory service.
Rather than sending all logs to a single event hub, you create an event hub for
each service:

![Diagram that shows an event hub for Active Directory logs and an event hub for activity logs](images/agent-tut-azure-event-hub-diagram.png)

This setup is more efficient than using a single event hub for all logs because
it:

* Ensures that you publish only the logs expected by the downstream
    integration.

* Saves bandwidth and compute resources because inputs only need to process
    relevant logs, rather than processing all the logs for all your monitored
    services, then discarding unneeded logs.

* Avoids duplicates that might result from multiple inputs inadvertently reading
    and processing the same logs.

For high-volume deployments, you might even want to have a dedicated event hub for each data stream.

</DocCallOut>

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-configure-azure-diagnostics"></div>

### Configure diagnostic settings to send logs to the event hub

Every Azure service that creates logs has diagnostic settings that allow you to
export logs and metrics to an external destination. In this step, you configure
the Azure Monitor service to export activity logs to the event hub you created
earlier.

To configure diagnostic settings for the Azure Monitor service:

1. Go to the Azure portal and go to **Home -> Monitor**.
1. In the navigation page, select **Activity log**, and then click
    **Export Activity Logs**.

1. Select your subscription and click **Add diagnostic setting**.
1. Enter a name for the diagnostic setting.
1. In the list of log categories, select the logs you want to export.
1. Under Destination details, select **Stream to an event hub** and select the
    namespace and event hub you created earlier. For example:

![Screenshot of Azure diagnostic settings showing Administrative, Security, ServiceHealth, and Alert logs categories selected](images/agent-tut-azure-log-categories.png)
1. Save the diagnostic settings.

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-configure-logs-integration"></div>

### Configure the Azure Logs integration to collect activity logs

Now that activity logs are streaming into the event hub, you can configure
the Azure activity log integration to ingest the logs.

To add the integration:

<DocTable columns={[
  {
    "title": "",
    "width": "50%"
  },
  {
    "title": "",
    "width": "50%"
  }
]}>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Eventhub**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>The name of the event hub you created earlier.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Connection String**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      The connection string primary key of the event hub
      namespace. To learn how to get the connection string, refer to
      [Get an Event Hubs connection string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string)
      in the Azure documentation.

      <DocCallOut title="Tip">
      Instead of copying the connection string from the RootManageSharedAccessKey
      policy, you should create a new shared access policy (with permission to listen)
      and copy the connection string from the new policy.
      </DocCallOut>
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Storage account**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>The name of a blob storage account that ((agent)) can use to store information about logs consumed by the agent. You can use the same storage account container for all integrations.</DocCell>
  </DocRow>
  <DocRow>
    <DocCell>**Storage account key**</DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      A valid access key defined for the storage account.


      ![Screenshot of integration settings for Azure activity logs](images/agent-tut-azure-activity-log-settings.png)
    </DocCell>
  </DocRow>
</DocTable>

1. Make sure the **Collect Azure activity logs from Event Hub** selector is
    turned on.

1. Under **Existing hosts**, select the agent policy that created earlier.

1. Save and deploy the integration.

    This step takes a minute or two to complete. When it's done, you'll have an
    agent policy that contains the Azure activity logs configuration plus the
    billing metrics configuration. The deployed ((agent)) will pick up the policy
    change and start sending Azure activity logs to ((es)).

<div id="azure-elastic-agent-visualize-azure-logs"></div>

## Step 5: Visualize Azure activity logs

Now that logs are streaming into ((es)), you can visualize them in ((kib)). To see
the raw logs, open the main menu in ((kib)), then click **Logs**. Notice that you
can filter on a specific data stream. This example uses
`data_stream.dataset : "azure.activitylogs"` to show Azure activity logs:

![Screenshot of Logs app showing Azure activity logs](images/agent-tut-azure-activity-logs.png)

<DocCallOut title="Tip">

The default view on the Stream page includes the Message column, which is not
populated for activity logs. To avoid seeing `failed to find message` repeated
on the Stream page, you can change the default columns shown in the view. On the
**Logs -> Stream** page, click **Settings** and delete the Message column. Add a
new column based on a different field, for example,
`azure.activitylogs.event_category`.

![Screenshot showing the log columns changed to include the azure.activitylogs.event_category field](images/agent-tut-azure-activity-log-columns.png)

</DocCallOut>

The Azure activity logs integration also comes with pre-built dashboards that
you can use to visualize the data. In ((kib)), open the main menu and click
**Dashboard**. Search for Azure activity and select the dashboard called
**[Logs Azure] User Activity**:
