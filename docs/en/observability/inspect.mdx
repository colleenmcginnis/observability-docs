<div id="inspect"></div>

The **Inspect** view in ((kib)) allows you to view information about all requests that were made to collect the data displayed on the current page.

Many requests go into building visualizations in ((kib)).
For example, to render visualizations in the ((uptime-app)), ((kib)) needs to request a list of all your monitors,
data about the availability of each monitor over time, and more.
If something goes wrong, the Inspect view can help you report an issue and troubleshoot with Elastic support.

Inspecting requests is available for the following apps:

* APM
* Uptime
* ((user-experience))
