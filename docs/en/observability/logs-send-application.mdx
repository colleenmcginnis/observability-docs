<div id="logs-send-application"></div>

The Java APM agent can automatically capture and send logs directly to the managed intake service â€” enabling you to
easily ingest log events without needing a separate log shipper like ((filebeat)).

**Requirements**

The Elastic APM agent for Java.

**Pros**

* Simple to set up as it only relies on the APM agent.
* No modification of the application required.
* No need to deploy ((filebeat)).
* No need to store log files in the file system.

**Cons**

* Experimental feature.
* Limited APM agent support.
* Not resilient to outages. Log messages can be dropped when buffered in the agent or in the managed intake service.

## Get started

See the [Java agent](((apm-java-ref))/logs.html#log-sending) documentation to get started.
