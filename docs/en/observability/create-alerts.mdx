Make sure alerting is already set up in ((kib)). For details, see

Alerting enables you to detect complex conditions defined by a **rule**
within the Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM apps. When a condition is met, the rule
tracks it as an **alert** and responds by triggering one or more **actions**.

Alerts and rules related to service level objectives (SLOs), and ((observability)) apps, including Logs, Infrastructure, Uptime, and APM, can be managed in the ((observability)) UI.
You can also manage ((observability)) app rules alongside rules for other apps from the [((kib)) Management UI](((kibana-ref))/create-and-manage-rules.html).
