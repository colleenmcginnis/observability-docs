Within the ((uptime-app)), create a **Monitor Status** rule to receive notifications
based on errors and outages.

1. To access this page, go to **((observability))** -> **Uptime**.
1. At the top of the page, click **Alerts and rules** -> **Create rule**.
1. Select **Monitor status rule**.

## Conditions

You can specify the following thresholds for your rule.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Status check** | Receive alerts when a monitor goes down a specified number of times within a time range (seconds, minutes, hours, or days). |
| **Availability** | Receive alerts when a monitor goes below a specified availability threshold within a time range (days, weeks, months, or years). |

Let's create a rule for any monitor that shows `Down` more than three times in 10 minutes.

This rule covers all the monitors you have running. You can use a query to specify
specific monitors, and you can also have different conditions for each one.

The final step when creating a rule is to select one or more actions to take when
the alert is triggered.

<div id="action-types-status"></div>

## Action types

You can extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following
supported built-in integrations. Actions are ((kib)) services or integrations with
third-party systems that run as background tasks on the ((kib)) server when rule conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the <DocLink slug="/en/observability/configure-uptime-settings" section="configure-connectors">Settings</DocLink> page.

After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency. You can choose to create a summary of alerts on each check interval or on a custom interval. For example, send email notifications that summarize the new, ongoing, and recovered alerts each hour:

{/* NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly. */}

Alternatively, you can set the action frequency such that you choose how often the action runs (for example, at each check interval, only when the alert status changes, or at a custom action interval). In this case, you must also select the specific threshold condition that affects when actions run: `Uptime Down Monitor` or `Recovered`.

You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box
and selecting from a list of available variables.

<div id="recovery-variables-status"></div>

## Alert recovery

To receive a notification when the alert recovers, select **Run when Recovered**. Use the default notification message or customize it. You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box and selecting from a list of available variables.
