If the Elastic ((security-features)) are enabled, you must also provide a user
ID and password so that ((metricbeat)) can collect metrics successfully:

    1. Create a user on the ((es)) cluster that has the
        `remote_monitoring_collector` [built-in role](((ref))/built-in-roles.html).
        Alternatively, if it's available in your environment, use the
        `remote_monitoring_user` [built-in user](((ref))/built-in-users.html).

    1. Add the `username` and `password` settings to the beat module configuration file.
