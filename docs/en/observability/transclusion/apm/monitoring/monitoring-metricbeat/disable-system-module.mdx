By default, the [system module](((metricbeat-ref))/metricbeat-module-system.html) is
enabled. The information it collects, however, is not shown on the
**((stack-monitor-app))** page in ((kib)). Unless you want to use that information for
other purposes, run the following command:

```sh
metricbeat modules disable system
```
