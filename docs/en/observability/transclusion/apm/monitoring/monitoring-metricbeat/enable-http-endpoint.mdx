Add the following setting in the APM Server configuration file
(`apm-server.yml`):

```yaml
http.enabled: true
```

By default, metrics are exposed on port 5066. If you need to monitor multiple
((beats)) shippers running on the same server, set `http.port` to expose metrics
for each shipper on a different port number:

```yaml
http.port: 5067
```
