Using Elastic ((observability)), learn how to analyze log data, monitor system and
service metrics, instrument code and collect performance data, and monitor host
availability and endpoints.

The ((stack)) provides a variety of ways to add monitoring data to ((es)).
The tutorials in this section focus on ((agent)) and ((beats)).

It's recommended that you use ((agent)), when possible, to achieve your monitoring
goals. However, if ((agent)) doesn't work for your use case, you can use ((beats))
instead.

Not sure which agent to use? Refer to
[((beats)) and ((agent)) capabilities](((fleet-guide))/beats-agent-comparison.html).
