There are three available filesets:
`audit`, `vpcflow`, `firewall`. This tutorial covers the `audit` fileset.

1. Go to the **Logs Router** page to configure GCP to export logs to a Pub/Sub
    topic. Use the search bar to find the page:

    ![Navigate to Logs Router page](images/monitor-gcp-navigate-logs-router.png)

    To set up the logs routing sink, click  **Create sink**.
    Set **sink name** as `monitor-gcp-audit-sink`. Select the **Cloud Pub/Sub topic** as the
    **sink service** and **Create new Cloud Pub/Sub topic** named `monitor-gcp-audit`:

    ![Create Pub/Sub topic](images/monitor-gcp-create-pubsub-topic.png)

    Finally, under **Choose logs to include in sink**, add
    `logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com"` (it includes all audit logs).
    Click **create sink**.  It will look something like the following:

1. Now go to the **Pub/Sub** page to add a subscription to the topic you just
    created. Use the search bar to find the page:

    ![GCP Pub/Sub](images/monitor-gcp-pub-sub.png)

    To add a subscription to the `monitor-gcp-audit` topic click
    **Create subscription**:

    ![Create GCP Pub/Sub Subscription](images/monitor-gcp-pub-sub-create-subscription.png)

    Set `monitor-gcp-audit-sub` as the **Subscription ID** and leave the
    **Delivery type** as pull:

    ![GCP Pub/Sub Subscription ID](images/monitor-gcp-pub-sub-subscription-id.png)

    Finally, scroll down and click **Create**.
