1. Go to the Observability UI and click **Add integrations**.
1. In the query bar, search for and select the **{props.integration_name}**
    integration.

1. Read the overview to make sure you understand integration requirements and
    other considerations.

1. Click **Add {props.integration_name}**.

    <DocCallOut title="Tip">
    If you're installing an integration for the first time, you may be prompted

1. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description. Make sure you
    configure all required settings.

1. Choose where to add the integration policy.
* If ((agent)) is not already deployed locally or on an EC2 instance, click
    **New hosts** and enter a name for the new agent policy.

* Otherwise, click **Existing hosts** and select an existing agent policy.
1. Click **Save and continue**. This step takes a minute or two to complete. When
    it's done, you'll have an agent policy that contains an integration policy
    for the configuration you just specified. If an ((agent)) is already assigned to
    the policy, you're done. Otherwise, you need to deploy an ((agent)).

1. To deploy an ((agent)):
    1. In the popup, click **Add ((agent)) to your hosts** to open the **Add agent**
        flyout. If you accidentally close the popup or the flyout doesn't open, go to
        **((fleet)) -> Agents**, then click **Add agent** to access the flyout.

    1. Follow the steps in the **Add agent** flyout to download, install,
        and enroll the ((agent)).

1. When incoming data is confirmed--after a minute or two--click **View assets**
    to access the dashboards.

[((fleet)) and ((agent)) documentation](((fleet-guide))/index.html).
