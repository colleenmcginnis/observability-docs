<div id="monitor-logs"></div>

The ((logs-app)) in ((kib)) enables you to search, filter, and tail all your logs
ingested into ((es)). Instead of having to log into different servers, change
directories, and tail individual files, all your logs are available in the ((logs-app)).

Logs Explorer allows you to quickly search and filter your log data, get information about the structure of log fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
Refer to the <DocLink slug="/en/observability/explore-logs">Logs Explorer</DocLink> documentation for more on using Logs Explorer.

The ((logs-app)) also provides:

* live <DocLink slug="/en/observability/tail-logs">streaming of logs</DocLink>, filtering using auto-complete, and a logs histogram for quick navigation.
* ((ml)) to detect specific <DocLink slug="/en/observability/inspect-log-anomalies">log anomalies</DocLink> automatically and <DocLink slug="/en/observability/categorize-logs">categorize log messages</DocLink> to quickly identify patterns in your
    log events.

To view the ((logs-app)), go to **((observability)) > Logs**.
