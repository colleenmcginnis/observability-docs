1. **Choose your source.** Elastic integrates with hundreds of data sources for
    unified visibility across all your applications and systems.

1. **Ingest your data.** Turn-key integrations provide a repeatable workflow to
    ingest data from all your sources: you install an integration, configure it, and
    deploy an agent to collect your data.

1. **View your data.** Navigate seamlessly between Observabilty UIs and
    dashboards to identify and resolve problems quickly.

1. **Customize.** Expand your deployment and add features like alerting and anomaly
    detection.
