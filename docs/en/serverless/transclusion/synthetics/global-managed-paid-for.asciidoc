Executing synthetic tests on Elastic's global managed testing infrastructure incurs an additional charge. Tests are charged under one of two new billing dimensions depending on the monitor type. For *browser monitor* usage, there is a fee per test run. For *lightweight monitor* usage, there is a fee per region in which you run any monitors regardless of the number of test runs.
